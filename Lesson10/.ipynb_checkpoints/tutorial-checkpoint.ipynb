    "\n",
    "Stemming is the process of reducing words to their stem (or root) word. For example, the words cats, catty, and catlike all have the stem cat. The act of stemming helps you analyze sentences by tokenizing them. Removing suffixes to create stem words and generally tokenizing sentences are only two parts of the process of creating something like a natural language interface. Languages include a great number of glue words that dont mean much to computer but have significant meaning to humans, such as a, as, the, that, and so on in English. These short, less useful words are stop words. Sentences dont make sense without them to humans, but for your computer, they can act as a means of stopping sentence analysis. <br /><br />\n",

You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such\\nas \"shift-Return\".\\n\\nIf anybody wants these changes, they\\'re welcome to them, but you\\'ll\\nhave to have the source available and be comfortable munging with\\nit a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code\\nin the source file \"x11term.c\".  Maybe if someone at OSF is \\ninterested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they\\'ve got\\nbigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about \\nemacs V19!).  If there\\'s sufficient interest, I\\'ll post the mods \\nsomewhere, although this probably isn\\'t the appropriate group for it.\\n\\nNotes: \\n\\n * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create\\n   its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which \\n   includes Xterm windows) then it\\'s business as usual.\\n\\n * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2\\n   [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].  The patches are\\n   in a chunk of code between \\'#if sun ... #endif\\' but could \\n   easily be adapted for anything else.\\n\\n\\n+-------------------------------------------------------+------- /// -----+\\n| Mark Lanzo   KD4QLZ  lanzo@tekelec.com   919-460-5576 |    \\\\\\\\\\\\///       |\\n+-------------------------------------------------------+---- \\\\XX/ -------+\\n',\n",

I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax\\nand license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.  \\nWhen I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could  \\nget to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he  \\nstarted adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had  \\nmiscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed  \\nanother $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was  \\ntheir problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then  \\nbrought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I  \\nreminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be  \\ntreated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole  \\ndeal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,  \\nsnatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by  \\nthe turn of events.\\n\\nEarly the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  \\nto know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and  \\nasked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him  \\nthat if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  \\nthat there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  \\nand that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  \\npretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to  \\nlose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told  \\nhim not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.\\n\\nA couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all  \\napologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus  \\nknock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about  \\nit and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,  \\nand assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....\\n\\nI thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  \\ndecided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him  \\nback and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the  \\ntruck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the  \\nincident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of  \\nthere in my new truck in about 30 mins.\\n\\nSo, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not  \\nhave happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales  \\nperson talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I  \\nsure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their  \\nmistake.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred  \\ndollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.  \\nI'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.\\n\\nMark\\n\",\n",

This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out\\nbinding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence\\nthat occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for\\nWarren\\'s fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in\\nso many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into\\nthe genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were\\nmuch elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was\\nrecognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created.\\nOther species have different sets of transposons.

Fridays all the time.)\\n\\n>It further at least implicitly advances the position that\\n>sciences goes \"forward\" (and it is not clear what this means given the\\n>context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational\\n>and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then\\n>weeded out via the \"critical function\" of science.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure that it\\'s random.  But there is no known rational mechanism\\nfor generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really\\nworking in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense\\nof what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best\\nthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.

Then we get varieties of pathological science:\\nLysenko, Mirsky\\'s opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.\\n\\n>If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are\\n>subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true\\n>of the application of any \"critical function\" concerning replication.\\n>This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an \"anything goes\" view.)\\n\\nI don\\'t agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at\\nwhich I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the\\nculture of science that one keeps one\\'s jealousies out of the refereeing\\nprocess.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.\\n\\nAnother point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental\\ndesign\\'\\'.  I\\'d say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,\\nnot design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for\\nbacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously\\nbeen found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny\\nnose, what the hell, it\\'s worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage\\nwas well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.\\n\\n>True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.

Perhaps\\nyou can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out\\nfor perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first\\nadvanced from logical grounds.

It\\nwould be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft.\\nThe idea was that you\\'d detonate devices with somewhere from one to\\nten megatons yield behind a \"pusher plate\" attached to the main\\nspacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer\\nmomentum to the ship.\\n\\n  Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion\\nheats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave\\ninto the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are\\ngoing to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton,\\nhelium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic\\nradiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission\\nproducts).\\n\\n  Would this work?

U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge\\nasks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because\\nof possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.\\n\\nThe testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently\\nended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither\\nby KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.\\n\\nThe day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,\\nwho had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person\\nnamed Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as\\nan informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms\\nin his dealings with Randy Weaver.\\n\\nFadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an\\nAryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two\\nthen met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in\\ntime) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons\\ntransaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, \"He felt like he\\n(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the\\nWhite cause.\"\\n\\nThe two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and\\nlater went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second\\nmeeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to\\ntape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-\\ngauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of\\n19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge\\nshotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of\\n24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel\\nlength and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver\\nis reported to have said that he could perform better work once\\nhis machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility\\nof future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars\\nfor the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty\\ndollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have\\nsimply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -\\nover a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).\\n\\nThe next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that\\nhis \"source\" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead\\nof the one-hundred fifty he\\'d promised.  At this point, Weaver\\nsuspected he was dealing with an informant, \"I had a guy in\\nSpokane tell me you were bad.\"  Fadeley managed to convince\\nWeaver otherwise.\\n\\nThe _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were\\nmade of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these\\nmeetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also\\nreported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki\\nWeaver (Randy Weaver\\'s wife) was played to the court.  There must\\nhave also been phone taps.\\n\\nThese tapes were played to the court via both headphones and\\nloudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver\\'s\\nattorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to\\nmake sure that the government proved its case, \"...if it has a\\ncase at all...\" according to the rules.\\n\\nRandy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his\\nwife\\'s voice on the tape.\\n\\nU.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear\\naccounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the\\nWeaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect\\nthis trial is not explained.\\n\\nOther notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning\\nKevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are\\nsurprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were\\nsurprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained\\nin the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy\\nWeaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that\\nHarris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report\\nthat the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming\\nat Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics\\nare charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the\\nonly non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and\\nDeputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that\\nHarris\\'s survival is simply due to divine intervention.\\n\\nTuesday, April 20, 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial. \\nKenneth Fadeley\\'s testimony is scheduled to continue. \\n\\n',\n",

Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much\\ndifferently than had one applied them within the confines of\\ntheir original expression.\\n\\nI think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior \\nof the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit\\nfrom Merlinus X\\' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes\\nto which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.\\nI have little knowledge regarding Reuss\\' background, but surely\\nhe was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order \\nfor many years.\\n\\nYet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back\\nso carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is\\nonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed\\nwhich extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there\\nwas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order\\nitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.\\n\\n\\nLet us examine this issue a bit more closely....\\n\\n\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist\\nand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo\\nTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \\nKellner\\'s efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\\nin Reuss\\'s Masonic publication, \\'Oriflamme\\'.  On Kellner\\'s death,\\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The \\'Jubilee\\' edition of\\nthe \\'Oriflamme\\', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\\nsecret of sexual magic.\\n \\n\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\\nLeague founded by Karl Marx\\'s daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\\n\\n\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss\\' leadership.\\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\\n\\n\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss\\'s request, deeply\\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"\\n\\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX\\'\\n\\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \\n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\\nfor very many interpretations.\\n\\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\\nsupport of the \\'Law of Thelema\\' is laughable at best.\\n\\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \\nWill I?  \\nI think not.\\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\\n\\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X\\'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\\nI do not support Reuss\\'s words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\\nthe Order has \\'gone soft\\' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\\n\\n\\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \\nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\\nof the organization as it stands.\\n\\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \\nI followed my intuition, and I\\'ve found little to stop me from requesting\\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I\\'m happily participating\\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\\nMass well enough for my tastes.\\n \\n\\nThis doesn\\'t make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\\nlimited contact with other members.\\n\\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\\nand the preservation of individual vision.\\n\\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\\nto other posts in this thread.\\n\\n\\nInvoke me under my stars.

For example \\n->anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see \\n->this right away.\\n->\\tTherefore since he wasn\\'t a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the \\n->real thing.  \\n\\n\\nOr might not have existed, or any number of things.  That is the logical pitfall that those who\\nuse flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, because\\nin the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are \\npossible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among\\nthe alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding\\nall other possible alternatives.\\n\\nHowever, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the \\nincomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at \\nleast one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn\\'t one of\\nthe other two alternative is no longer valid.\\n\\n->\\tSome other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in \\n->the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal \\n->and Crucifixion.  I don\\'t have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I \\n->write I will use it.\\n\\nJC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn\\'t be any great shakes to make\\nsure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.  What would be compeling is if there\\nwere a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then,  yet \\nfullfilled them anyway.\\n\\n->\\tI don\\'t think most people understand what a Christian is.  It \\n->is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.  Rather I think it \\n->should be a way of life, and a total sacrafice of everything for God\\'s \\n->sake.  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the \\n->same.  Hey we can\\'t do it, God himself inspires us to turn our lives \\n->over to him.  That\\'s tuff and most people don\\'t want to do it, to be a \\n->real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at.  But \\n->just like weight lifting or guitar playing, drums, whatever it takes \\n->time.  We don\\'t rush it in one day, Christianity is your whole life.  \\n->It is not going to church once a week, or helping poor people once in \\n->a while.  We box everything into time units.  Such as work at this \\n->time, sports, Tv, social life.  God is above these boxes and should be \\n->carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for \\n->ourselves.  \\n\\nHere I agree with you.  Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says \\nseriously, and what it says is that it must be a total way of life.  I have very little respect for \\nXians that don\\'t.  If the myth is true, then it is true in its entirity.  The picking and choosing\\nthat I see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\nJim\\t  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJames L.

The Jews of Jesus\\'s time believed that all sickness was the\\nresult of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was\\nblind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.

Is it AIDS ?\\n>I don\\'t know.\\n\\nAtonement is *extremely* important, but I think you\\'ve missed the mark\\nabout as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin.\\nThe atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central\\nmessage of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins,\\nand was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of\\nour sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for\\nour sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He\\nhas graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or \\nsome other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting\\non the sacrifice that Jesus made.\\n\\nIn case you couldn\\'t tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when\\nI see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and\\nphobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other\\nsocially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through\\ntheir own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ,\\nno more and no less than we do.  I\\'ve said this before, but I think\\nit\\'s a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus\\nhealed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on\\nthis earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS.\\nShe has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed \\nrelationship with God.  Her theology isn\\'t what I would want it to be,\\nbut God\\'s grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining\\nweight (she\\'s had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is\\nexcellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes\\nher improvement in her health to God\\'s intervention in her life.  Who\\nare we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It\\nseems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.\\n\\nPaul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I \\nthink applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I\\n(or something like that).\\n\\nMay we all experience and accept God\\'s grace.\\n>\\n>-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n>Mark Ashley                        |DISCLAIMER: The opinions expressed\\n>marka@gcx1.ssd.csd.harris.com      |here are my own; they do not\\n>..!uunet!gcx1!marka               |reflect the opinion or policies\\n>The Lost Los Angelino              |of Harris Corporation.\\n>-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n===============================================================================\\nPaul Conditt\\t\\tInternet: conditt@titan.tsd.arlut.utexas.edu\\nApplied Research\\tPhone:\\t  (512) 835-3422   FAX: (512) 835-3416/3259\\n  Laboratories\\t\\tFedex:\\t  10000 Burnet Road, Austin, Texas 78758-4423\\nUniversity of Texas\\tPostal:\\t  P.O.

Reproduced under open license granted by Audio\\nBooks, Inc.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington,\\nDC  20006.\\n\\n   Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30,\\n1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.\\n\\n  It\\'s now been almost one month since war broke out in the South\\nAtlantic.  On the surface it seems that it\\'s only a dispute\\nbetween Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept\\nFalkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it\\'s far\\nmore than that.\\n\\n   The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a\\ngiant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,\\nfierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South\\nAtlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the\\nhostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on\\nall sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the\\nSouthern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.\\n\\n   Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of\\nthe Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a\\ncounterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.\\n\\n   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of\\ntime, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is\\ncoming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are\\noverextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty\\'s navy cannot\\nsimply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time\\nwithout drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British\\nwill be forced to undertake military operations very soon no\\nmatter how risky they may be.\\n\\n   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no\\nchoice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That\\nreason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered\\nlosses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will\\nbe no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by\\nthe British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts\\nwill the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle\\nlosses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice\\nbut to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking\\neven heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,\\nmy friends, Her Majesty\\'s navy has sailed into a trap.\\n\\n   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,\\nironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we\\'ve been hearing\\ncountless commentators referring to the British task force as an\\n\"armada\" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very\\nuneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400\\nyears ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,\\nbut it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it\\nchanged the course of history--and it was none other than the\\nEnglish navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.\\n\\n   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the\\nreign of England\\'s Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion\\nfleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. \\nThey were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake\\nand his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada\\nby changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped\\nwith new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of\\nreach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered\\nthe big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely\\nhalf the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake\\'s\\ndefeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened\\nthe door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its\\nexpansion into a truly global empire.\\n\\n   Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full\\ncircle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the\\nworld empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now\\nthe cultures of England and of Spain are once again in\\nconfrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for\\ninvasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four\\nhundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;\\ntoday, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.\\n\\n   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake\\nPassage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of\\nthe Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain\\'s\\nnaval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may\\nwell break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal\\nNavy.\\n\\n   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:\\n\\nTopic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND\\nTopic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\\nTopic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.\\n\\nTopic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month\\nit looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and\\na half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great\\nBritain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the\\nFalklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been\\ncountless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it\\ncalls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing\\nin the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about\\nthem.\\n\\n   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba\\nis from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. \\nAfter 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer\\nthan 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the\\nremote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,\\nand yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are\\nwatching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.\\n\\n   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all\\nabout its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO\\'s\\ndoorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it\\'s\\ngot at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,\\nsubmarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have\\neven been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. \\nWave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated\\nand sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and\\nsubmarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and\\nsent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has\\ngrown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada\\nnumbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has\\nalready been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.\\n\\n   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What\\'s this\\nfight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the\\nmajor media is \"oil.\"  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist\\nunder the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,\\nbut that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it\\nexplain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina\\nthis month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine\\nseizure of South Georgia Island.\\n\\n   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with\\nno known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South\\nGeorgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia\\nIsland is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,\\nglaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. \\nOn top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or\\nhistorical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it\\nstands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.\\n\\n   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by\\nArgentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took\\nover the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,\\nArgentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,\\nnot Britain.\\n\\n   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It\\nhas always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or\\nSpain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even\\nmore unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina\\'s\\nleaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They\\nwere well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island\\ncould not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were\\nsetting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island\\nwas retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina\\'s\\nmilitary junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia\\nIsland at all?\\n\\n   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,\\nnot political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an\\nenormous military secret.  It\\'s a giant underground installation\\nburied under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. \\nThe real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret\\ninstallation, together with two other similar installations which\\nI will describe shortly.\\n\\n   The secret military complexes have been in existence for many\\nyears; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear\\nwar timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in\\nWashington.  For the past two months I\\'ve been reporting the\\ndetails of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain\\nand verify them.\\n\\n   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of\\nthis year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat\\nthat caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.\\n\\n   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of\\nthe Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The\\nmutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the\\nRockefeller cartel--and Russia\\'s new rulers in the Kremlin are\\nbehind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of\\nthe \"PROJECT Z\" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase\\nis to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both\\nRussia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR\\nONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the\\nexistence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around\\nthe world.\\n\\n   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are\\nworking with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of\\nother countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to\\nride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in\\nGovernment war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie\\nsmoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered\\nremains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the\\nsecret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the\\nopen.  They will confront the world with the only remaining\\nfresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using\\nthat military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of\\nthe world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to\\npave the way for world domination very soon by setting off\\nNUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel\\nand Russia\\'s new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a\\nrace against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.\\n\\n   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are\\nbenefitting from war preparations which were started by the\\nRockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since\\nthe Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United\\nStates Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United\\nStates Government has been a house divided, torn by internal\\npower struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. \\nBut before that, the United States had been dominated for decades\\nboth economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller\\nBrothers.\\n\\n   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world\\ndomination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half\\nsecret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. \\nIt was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret\\nwhile appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the\\ndetails, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By\\ndeliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United\\nStates would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. \\nThen the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be\\nunleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.\\n\\n   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the\\nRockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the\\nlate 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that\\nthe war being planned would have very different effects on the\\nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United\\nStates and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern\\nHemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great\\nBritain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the\\nstrategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are\\nrelatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected\\nthat the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern\\nHemisphere war.\\n\\n   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious\\nradioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas\\nnot initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the\\nwar clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is\\nvery little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern\\nHemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from\\nthe North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then\\nit works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image\\nof this process takes up the southern half of the planet. \\nNorthern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,\\nbut very little of the air changes places.\\n\\n   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming\\nnuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for\\ngenerations to come; but if the calculations are right, the\\nSouthern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. \\nThis was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A\\nquick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller\\ncartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I\\ndiscussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson\\nRockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during\\nthe war.  He accomplished this as so-called \"Coordinator of\\nHemispheric Defense\" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. \\nSo that takes care of the South American continent and its\\nnatural resources.\\n\\n   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller\\ncontrol was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,\\nespecially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the\\nefforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER\\nNo. 36.\\n\\n   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land\\nmasses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and\\nNew Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the\\nRockefellers.\\n\\n   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military\\ninstallations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming\\nwar.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the\\nsurviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern\\nHemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually\\nrecovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire\\nwould be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third\\ngeneration Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to\\ninherit the Earth.\\n\\n   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after\\nthe war, some means would have to be available to project\\nmilitary power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against\\nRockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the\\nbeam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar\\nmilitary domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A\\nminimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based\\nin the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the\\nreserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the\\nNorthern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in\\nexisting shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built\\nand they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no\\nsmall task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was\\nessential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. \\nThe best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and\\nnaval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the\\nsecret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear\\nattack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered\\nprematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.\\n\\n   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection\\nagainst attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all\\nthese plans were still in the early stages of development, the\\nanswer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to\\nSweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden\\nnaval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs\\nwhich come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is\\na gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off\\nwith enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water\\na huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.\\n\\n   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided\\nthat a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the\\nSwedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of\\ncandidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered\\ncoastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas\\nwere rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. \\nOther areas were rejected because they were too close to the\\nequator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too\\nmany people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy\\nimpossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for\\nthe secret naval installations be totally secure politically.\\n\\n   At last the sites for the secret naval installations were\\nselected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was\\nselected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71\\nthree months ago when I called attention to New Zealand\\'s extreme\\nimportance in the coming war.\\n\\n   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand\\nnaval installation had to be divided up into two sites located\\nclose together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South\\nIsland where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes\\ndown virtually to the water\\'s edge.  The other part of the\\ninstallation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,\\nwhich is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island\\nfacility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.\\n\\n   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since\\nWorld War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even\\ncloser to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location\\nis far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep\\nunder mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also\\ntoo deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New\\nZealand site is well situated to command the entire South\\nPacific.\\n\\n   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. \\nThat site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located\\nperfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The\\ntall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret\\ninstallation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. \\nIt is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of\\nNew Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island\\nwas virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the\\nnortheast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from\\nthe secret new installation which was being built, but Britain\\ntook no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. \\nSince that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia\\nIsland except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.\\n\\n   Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New\\nZealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960\\'s. \\nThe techniques were adapted from those used previously to build\\nother large underground facilities, such as the NORAD\\ninstallation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these\\ntechniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve\\nconstruction access directly from the sea instead of overland. \\nIn this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in\\nappearance both during and after construction.\\n\\n   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let\\nships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well\\ncamouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the\\nentrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When\\nsealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you\\nknow exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction\\nprojects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying\\naround to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house\\nthe secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and\\ndebris was disposed of at sea.\\n\\n   Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be\\noutfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake\\ndisarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed\\ngreatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal\\nrole in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary\\nof Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60\\'s McNamara\\npresided over the public paring back of America\\'s visible\\nmilitary power.  This included the closing down and dismantling\\nof entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that\\nshipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,\\nwas to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in\\nNew Zealand and South Georgia Island!\\n\\n   The secret naval installations have been used as duplication\\nfacilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and\\nbuilt here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar\\nWeinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two\\nships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is\\nan exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true\\nin recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing\\ntechniques.\\n\\n   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret\\ninstallations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of\\ncertain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear\\npowered--nuclear \"subs\"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;\\nand yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin\\nwas built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and\\nfor the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been\\nfinanced through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we\\nconstantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three\\ncarriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft\\nwhose manufacture was financed the same way!\\n\\n   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are\\nall duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the\\nsecret naval ships possess one key difference.\\n\\n   Last month I revealed that the so-called \"Stealth Program\" has\\nsucceeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility\\nshield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance\\nby distorting light waves in its vicinity.\\n\\n   A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into\\ncrash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of\\nthe secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been\\noutfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth\\nprinciple is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes\\nbecause there is more room for the powerful equipment that\\ngenerates the field.\\n\\n   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American\\nBolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on\\nearth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world\\ndomination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my\\nfriends, but three years ago they lost control of the United\\nStates Military.  Now it\\'s the American Bolsheviks who are in\\ncontrol, and they are bent on war.\\n\\n   These secret naval installations have precipitated what is\\nbeing called the \"Falklands crisis.\"\\n\\nTopic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described\\n\"PROJECT Z\", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR\\nWAR ONE.\\n\\n   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here\\nare flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in\\nWashington.  It\\'s a plan by which the United States will strike\\nthe first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war\\nwith Russia.\\n\\n   Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in\\ncertain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable\\nwar bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in\\nstalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United\\nStates and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand\\nstrategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially\\ntheir secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and\\nrule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it\\nwill be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks\\nthemselves, this outcome will constitute victory.\\n\\n   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two\\nmonths ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for\\nnuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is\\nfast running out.\\n\\n   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward\\nwar; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in\\nthis race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are\\nequally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the\\nBolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the\\nnew anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two\\nmutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in\\ncertain ways.\\n\\n   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a\\nlimited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between\\nthe Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting\\nbetween Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning\\npoint in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,\\nand is responsible for the so-called \"Falkland crisis\" now\\ndominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new\\nrelationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far\\nshort of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be\\nsettled between them, but for the time being they have called a\\ntruce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly\\nenemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.\\n\\n   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to\\nslow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. \\nIf they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller\\ncartel in certain political movements which I discussed last\\nsummer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war\\ntimetable will also give more breathing space for additional\\nanti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.\\n\\n   The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February\\nthat military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very\\nquickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect\\nfast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.\\n\\n   The exact details of the \"PROJECT Z\" war plan are not known to\\neither the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines\\nare known to be as I described last month.\\n\\n   It was decided that military action should be devised that\\nwould undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the\\nBolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the\\nSouthern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working\\ntogether, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to\\ndevise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. \\nThe Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these\\nbases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to\\nattack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine\\nprovided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.\\n\\n   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both\\nsecret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be\\nattacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the\\nBolshevik war plan still workable.\\n\\n   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault\\non the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was\\nno combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force\\nwhich could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside\\nworld.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the\\nvery war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.\\n\\n   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different\\nmatter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was\\nalso its Achilles\\' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected\\nthe secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military\\nassault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her\\nlong-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.\\n\\n   As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has\\ndominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives\\nwere sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government\\nmilitary junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland\\nIslands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to\\nenable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine\\ngenerals were not told everything about the situation by any\\nmeans, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to\\ndo.\\n\\n   As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were\\npromised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the\\nshooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine\\nhands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military\\nassistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the\\ntroubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller\\ncartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With\\nthese combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,\\nthe Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.\\n\\n   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack\\nplan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,\\nlanded at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia\\nIsland.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old\\nbuildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they\\nalso raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,\\nalways nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as\\nexpected.  The British Antarctic survey ship \"Endurance\" put 22\\nMarines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down\\nthe Argentine flag.\\n\\n   The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine\\nJunta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a\\nboil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that\\nSouth Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered\\nthat way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now\\ncame in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from\\nArgentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.\\n\\n   During late March, Argentine military forces started\\nassembling for an assault on the Falklands.  \"Nothing new\",\\nthought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out\\nthreatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed\\nthat they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine\\nforces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this\\ntime they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine\\npublic statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims\\nto the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next\\nday a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia\\nIsland.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance\\ninitially that it was just a side show from Argentina\\'s point of\\nview; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were\\noverpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13\\nalleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint\\nRockefeller-Russian attack plan.\\n\\n   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine\\nforces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. \\nBased on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the\\nteam moved to a location on the mountain directly above the\\ncavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was\\nset up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian\\nmembers concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,\\nApril 3, the military high command in London finally learned what\\nwas really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under\\nattack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint\\nRockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the\\nmountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a\\nmatter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling\\nof the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next\\nstep was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a\\nweapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it\\nwould be a nerve gas.\\n\\n   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the\\nBritish government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be\\ndescribed, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the\\nso-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik\\ncontrolled.  That\\'s why Margaret Thatcher always says, \"Me, too\"\\nany time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against\\nRussia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war\\nplan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective\\ncountries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered\\nthat their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.\\n\\n   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval\\narmada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of\\nthe day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding\\naround the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling\\nwould break through into the roof of the naval base in about\\nthree weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South\\nGeorgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The\\nforces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend\\nthemselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships\\nwere ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to\\nsail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with\\ntactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance\\ndoors would be suicide.\\n\\n   On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was\\nseized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. \\nThe same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He\\nwas forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the\\nRockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack\\npreparations.\\n\\n   That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other\\nsecret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. \\nThe two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on \"Red\\nAlert.\"  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin\\nbase were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at\\nsea undergoing \"sea trials\", but that still left seven (7) major\\nships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the\\nnuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.\\n\\n   On that busy day of April 5, Argentina\\'s Foreign Minister,\\nCosta Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was\\nalarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. \\nCosta Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from\\ncertain officials.  He got them!\\n\\n   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories\\nabout the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while\\nnegotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story. \\nThe Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as\\npossible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived\\nin time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The\\nofficial stories about \"slow movement\" of the British armada were\\nintended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,\\nthe fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,\\nthen it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the\\nannounced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South\\nGeorgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.\\n\\n   It was initially expected that advance elements of the British\\nfleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two\\nweeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint\\nRockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it\\nwas completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a\\nshambles of the plan.\\n\\n   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent\\nleft Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was\\nannounced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into\\ntrouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on\\na single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on\\nSouth Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and\\ncombat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In\\nmoments the ship was without any command, its communications and\\nradar silenced.  Then a Russian \"sub\" closed in and quickly\\nfinished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke\\napart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is\\nknown, there were no survivors.\\n\\n   This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two\\nresults, both important:\\n\\nFirst, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic\\nby the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a\\nconfiguration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost\\nvaluable time.  Public announcements from London about the\\nprogress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for\\narrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching\\nout longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint\\ncommando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.\\n\\nThe other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was\\nflashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible\\naction.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting\\ninvolved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could\\nbe in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the\\nseven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in\\nsouthern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational\\nheadquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast\\nof New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to\\nprovide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible\\nto communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I\\nexplained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the\\nStealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded\\ncommunication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes\\nheadquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South\\nGeorgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of\\nSouth America.  The deployment of the available ships of the\\nSouth Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint\\nRockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been\\nflushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in\\nNew Zealand!\\n\\n   The British ship\\'s sinking of April 14 was also followed by\\nother events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out\\nof port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos\\nAires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he\\nwas there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top\\nGovernmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have\\nrevealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did\\nnot get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four\\ndays later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded\\nhis plane, Haig somberly told reporters, \"Time is running out.\" \\nAnd so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.\\n\\n   The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the\\nhollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military\\nanalysts in London had not expected that it could be completed\\nuntil at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was\\nstill out of range.\\n\\n   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the\\nlong hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was\\ndetonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the\\neffects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed\\neveryone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the\\nbomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside\\nsufficiently to badly disable them.\\n\\n   Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging\\non the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands\\nawaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to\\nthe eye due to their protective shields, which also protect\\nagainst beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the\\ntactics which the Russians employed.\\n\\n   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships\\nusing their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. \\nAs I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which\\nPRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations\\nof the ships to the attack submarines.  The \"subs\" were armed\\nwith special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to\\nexplode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been\\nthrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective\\nshield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right\\nthrough each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. \\nWithin 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik\\nStealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went\\ntheir Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from\\naround the world.\\n\\n   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local\\ntime.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. \\nThat evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public\\nwith the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was\\nwearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught\\nalways to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning\\nfrom ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian\\nmilitary operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret\\nBolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,\\nbottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific\\nfleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By\\nworking together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won\\nthe secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.\\n\\nTopic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression\\nthat war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real\\nwar in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are\\nwatching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That\\naftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been\\npromised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.\\n\\n   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing\\nfor a public announcement that the United States will side with\\nBritain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat\\nup fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to\\nfight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be\\nexplained without a public battle; but by fighting, the\\nBolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and\\ntragic defeat for the Royal Navy.\\n\\n   Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now\\nconcentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On\\nall sides now we are hearing about the so-called \"nuclear freeze\\nmovement.\"  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all\\nkinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent\\nmonths, there have even been referenda popping up on election\\nballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are\\nbanding together to warn the public about what would happen if\\nthere were a nuclear war.\\n\\n   We are being told that all this is just popping up\\nspontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and\\nnothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet\\nnow we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have\\nspontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you\\nbelieve that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,\\nand I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and\\nmoney--and plenty of it.\\n\\n   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations\\nmachine at work.  As I\\'ve explained in the past, the Rockefeller\\ncartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it\\ndoes, they will lose everything because they are not in a\\nposition to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the\\nRockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is\\na war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in\\nits power to prevent a nuclear war.\\n\\n   The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller\\ncartel creates certain temporary common interests between them\\nand Russia; but as Russia\\'s new rulers know very well, this does\\nnot spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the\\nRockefeller group.  It\\'s purely a matter of practical necessity\\nright now for the Rockefellers.\\n\\n   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and\\nthey are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with\\nthe Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of\\nthe deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear\\nwar; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of\\nreckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.\\n\\n   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective\\nwith their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is\\nrenewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old\\ndream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly\\nprovided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar\\ncampaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan\\nAdministration has become so hawkish that it\\'s scaring people. \\nThe Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on\\nthat latent fear as a tool of power.\\n\\n   These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands\\ncrisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller\\npropaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that\\nsurrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new\\nsuper-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the\\nbill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new\\norganization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working\\nname, though this may be changed, is the \"World Nonproliferation\\nCouncil.\"  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of\\nnuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be\\nto use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.\\n\\n                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY\\n\\n   Now it\\'s time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO\\nLETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called\\nFalkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret\\nBolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern\\nHemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the\\nRockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down\\nthe nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the\\nresults remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal\\nNavy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain\\'s Waterloo at sea\\nmay well be at hand.\\n\\n   My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our\\nUnited States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They\\ndiffer in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we\\nare ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the\\npower of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture\\ntells us, our Lord \"...has not given us the spirit of fear; but\\nof power, of love, and of a sound mind.\"  We must learn to wage\\npeace.  As our Lord declared long ago, \"Blessed are the\\npeacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.\"\\n\\n   Until next month, God willing, this is Dr. Beter.  Thank you,\\nand may God bless each and every one of you.\\x1a\\n',\n",

(Even so, my\\nmetabolism is so low that when I\\'m at rest I\\'m most comfortable\\nwith a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if\\nit drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess\\nounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that\\nweigh slightly less than others.

We're here at the Pittsburgh \\nInternational Airport and with me is the President of the United \\nStates Bill Clinton.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There are a lot of things we'd like to talk \\nabout in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just \\nbreaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been \\nkind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in \\nthe trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard \\nthat two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and \\nOfficer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been \\nfound not guilty.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It's a situation that's been building for over a \\nyear since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.  \\nAnd I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see \\nthe situation in Los Angeles in connection with your \\nadministration and what you're trying to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the \\nAmerican people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a \\ntribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the \\nefforts of the federal government in developing the case.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The law under which the officers were tried is a \\ncomplex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury \\ndecided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible \\nfor supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did \\nmost of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked \\nRodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some \\nblows, and another officer who was a rookie.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but \\nit appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They \\nacknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think \\nthat the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But \\nI hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:  \\nfirst of all, the importance of trying to bring this country \\ntogether and not violate the civil rights of any American; \\nsecondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think it's important to recognize that in the \\npoorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this \\ncountry, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're \\neven more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our \\nefforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police \\nofficers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a \\nwaiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some \\nother things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to \\nviolence and drugs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to \\nme that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic \\nrevitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed \\nareas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles \\nwho wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many \\nproblems as we do.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I laid out a very ambitious program in the \\ncampaign to try to bring private investment and public investment \\nto bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary, \\nRon Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies \\nfor that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest \\nunemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the \\ncountry.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to \\nthe new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several \\nother people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with \\nregard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Let's talk about what brings you to the \\nPittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a \\nlot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.  \\nYou've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you \\nsaid earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break \\nthat gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to \\nAllegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that \\nbattle?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First \\nof all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported \\nme in the last election because they wanted a new direction in \\neconomic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it \\ngives the country a very different budget for the next five years \\nthan we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, \\nat the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and \\nhealth care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the \\nshort run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money \\nto create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; \\nto try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also \\nto try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The \\nplan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the \\nSenate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a \\nbloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come \\nto a vote.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote \\nfor the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican \\nleader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to \\nstay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases \\nthe deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending \\ntargets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for \\nthis year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five \\nyears.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the \\neconomy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that \\nare holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for \\nbillions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind --\\nmuch of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.  \\nI've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I \\nthink that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work \\nright now to show that we're changing the direction of the \\ncountry.  And that's the purpose of the bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or \\nhis office lately?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk \\nregularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison \\noperation to the senators that we think are open to this --\\nSenator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords \\nfrom Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six \\nothers whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and \\nknow that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life \\nof the budget I presented.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've \\ngot a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth \\nis that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life \\nof the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we \\nhave this program well below the spending targets that Congress \\nhas already approved for this year.  And they've done this for \\nyears, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans \\nvoting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as \\nputting the American people back to work.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I just hope that this doesn't become a political \\nissue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and \\nthe need for jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I have some questions from people who supported \\nyou, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.  \\nIt has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot \\nof people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I \\nthink some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the \\nWhite House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go \\nthrough.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And \\nthey're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull \\nit off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew \\nit was going to be like this.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask \\npeople, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving \\nvery fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the \\nfastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in \\nhistory, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we \\nare moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on \\npolitical reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole \\nwide range of things.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn \\nit around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions \\nwhich led to the victory I received from the people in November, \\nand we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making \\nreal, real progress.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would urge the people not to get discouraged.  \\nWe're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going \\nto happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing \\nthings.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Thank you very much.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, \\nhere live at Pittsburgh International Airport.  I'm Mike Whitely, \\nKDKA News.\\n\\n                               END10:31 A.M. EDT\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Ipser, Jr., 1993\\n>\\n\\nHere\\'s my own top ten response to Mr. Ipser\\'s list\\n\\n\\n10.  It\\'s about time we have a President that might actually stand up to the\\n     military.  Our men and women in uniform must learn that the world does not\\n     revolve around them, and that one of the things they\\'re out there defending\\n     is our right to be critical of them, even denounce them.\\n\\n9.   Let me explain something to you.  Environmental policy and industrial\\n     policy MUST go hand in hand.  Our nation, and indeed, our planet cannot\\n     afford to continue ignoring this as was done over the last twelve years.\\n     Our industrial/environmental position has been downright SHAMEFUL! We\\n     must have active government support of the key industries such as,\\n     telecommunications, microelectronics, medical, biotech, and environmental\\n     tech.  Meanwhile weed out old, inneficient, high-polution, industries\\n     that are better left to other nations.  This will make us richer, help\\n     produce new jobs, and help the environment.  To give credit where credit\\n     is due, I heard a lot of this in a speech by Senator John Kerry (D-MA)\\n     tonite.  In addition, it\\'s time we get really, really serious about \\n     issues like overpopulation, globabl warming, and ozone depletion.  The\\n     planet on which we live should be our utmost priority!\\n\\n8.   It just so happens that that it takes money to make this country work,\\n     to provide the services that people need, and to help solve the problems\\n     that need to be solved.  Granted, some things can probably be done more\\n     efficiently for less money, and should be.  But some things are going to\\n     cost more money and I\\'m sick and tired of hearing everyone whining about\\n     taxes all the time.  You want to live in my country, you pay your fair\\n     share!\\n\\n7.   I can\\'t believe what hypocrites people are when they ask people to give\\n     up their lives for their country and then complain about taxes.  If you\\'re\\n     willing to send me off to die for some stupid obsession with fighting an\\n     enemy which at best doesn\\'t affect us and at worst really should be our\\n     friend, then you have no right to tell me you shouldn\\'t pay taxes!\\n\\n6.   Hey, I think the beaded curtains add a lovely 60\\'s-esque touch!\\n\\n5.   Look, Canada, Europe, and Japan manage to provide health care for their\\n     citizens (and, yes, basic health IS a human right which people are\\n     entitled to).  If these nations aren\\'t capitalist enough for you, then\\n     I guess we\\'ve found something better than capitalism!  There is nothing\\n     sacred about the capitalist system, and if something, be it socialism\\n     or anything else, works better, then I say let capitalism die.\\n\\n4.   Make love, not War!\\n\\n3.   Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to be a male and a feminist\\n     at the same time.  To discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity\\n     to a MAJORITY of the population is just plain wrong, and trying to force\\n     them into some sort of tradition role is even worse.  Women certainly \\n     have as much to offer this world as men, and the day that gender\\n     discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of\\n     the past few centuries seem like reform bills.  I look forward to it.\\n\\n2.   See number 10.\\n\\n1.

It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every  \\nday.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I  \\ncan't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same  \\napplication. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  \\nthat caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I  \\nneed to re-boot.\\n\\nSome background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I  \\nfirst got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many  \\nGPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows  \\n(with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge  \\nmachine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into  \\nthe motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  \\nthe motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I  \\nwas told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  \\nboard.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  \\nSAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  \\nfine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.\\n\\nThe reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  \\nrebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves  \\nthe machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't. \\n\\nI haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said  \\nthese GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire  \\nday using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's  \\nin the sppace of 20 minutes?\\n\\nWhat can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good  \\ndiagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software  \\nproblem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After  \\nDark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or  \\ngdi.exe.\\n\\nAny help is truly appreciated.....\\n\\n-Eric\\n\\nebosco@us.oracle.com\\n\",\n",

I also didn't\\nthink Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who)\\nin the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in\\nregardless.\\n\\n>Oh well, at least the Bruins lost in O.T. also Ha, Ha!!--)\\n\\nYep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second,\\nIMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.\\n\\nSpeaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a\\nteam so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their\\nzone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red \\nArmy.  \\n\\nBut I still hate the team.\\n\\nOn the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a\\npowerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit. \\nSame goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is\\nwaving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.  New\\nJersey was overmatched, Terreri's heroics notwithstanding.

In most of this thread, I have\\nbeen concerned with the difference between what is science and\\nwhat is not. \\n\\nLee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between\\nEinstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of\\ntheir thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a\\ngenius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts\\nare scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or\\nKorzybski as examples.  If you don\\'t like these, choose your\\nown.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre\\nphysicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and\\nthe mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the\\ncumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong.\\nBoth Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to\\ndo this.  \\n\\nLet me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked\\nto review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many\\nkinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is\\nthat the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of\\ncriticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either\\nnot important or not interesting.  The first difference is the\\none that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the\\none that Lee Lady seems to be discussing. \\n\\n> If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit\\n> to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information.\\n> But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This\\n> is where you and I disagree with Turpin.  \\n\\nI have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered \\nscientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims,\\nnot just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspect\\nthat traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work;\\nwhat it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the\\npresence of qi.\\n\\n> ... In order to have science, one must have a theoretical\\n> structure that makes sense, not a mere collection of empirically\\n> validated random hypotheses.\\n\\nCertainly a \"theoretical structure that makes sense\" is the goal.\\nIn areas where we do not yet have this, I see nothing wrong with\\nforming and testing smaller hypotheses.  Let\\'s face it: we cannot\\nalways wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything\\nclear for us.  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to\\nplug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can. \\n\\nRussell\\n',\n",

I \\nthink it more likely that Mr Archer\\'s investigations into \"contradictions\" to \\nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \\nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \\nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\\nto support Mr Archer\\'s contentions). \\n\\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson\\'s) is the definition of\\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\\nBullinger\\'s exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\\nadmit how stupid Bullinger\\'s exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\\nwhich drives the point home). \\n\\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \\nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \\nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\\ndiscussing the \"Potter\\'s Field.\"\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler\\n\\n    Precise knowledge is the only true knowledge, and he who does not teach\\n    exactly, does not teach at all.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHenry Ward Beecher\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAmerican Clergyman\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas recorded by George Seldes\\n',\n",

       " u'From: schmidt@auvax1.adelphi.edu\\nSubject: Grounding power wiring, was Re: a question about 120VAC outlet wiring\\nLines: 163\\nNntp-Posting-Host: auvax1\\nOrganization: Adelphi University, Garden City NY\\n\\nThere has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding\\npractices here.  A few points need to be clarified:\\n\\nThe Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or\\nthe metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to\\ncarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the\\nvoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It\\nshould never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the\\nnormal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in\\nthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding\\nconductor.  \\n\\nMuch communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages\\non the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding\\nconductors to provide reliable operation  (\"orange\" outlets are often used for\\nthis, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in\\nmany cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read\\nboth the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on\\ninstalling quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated\\ngrounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors\\nback to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service\\nentrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many\\nof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide\\na safe ground or a quiet ground or either. \\n\\nThe GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is\\nreferred to in the code as the \"identified\" conductor and is supposed to be\\nwhite or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in\\nmost electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance\\npanel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household\\nservice panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which\\nattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  \\n\\nThe Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In\\nthe case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the\\ncircuit from the panel to the load device.  \\n\\nSince the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding\\nconductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance\\nfrom the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but\\nmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,\\nunder normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the\\ngrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of\\nthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since\\nthere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also\\nno longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment\\nhas a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \"U\"\\nground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. \\nThe difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few\\ntenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not\\npresent a shock hazard.  \\n\\nHOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact\\nwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,\\na metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to\\nflow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you\\nwill get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)\\nUnder the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in\\nsome cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of\\ninadequate size, causing it to overheat.\\n\\nWith the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a\\nshort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may\\nflow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which\\nincreases the possibility for shock or fire.  \\n\\nAlso if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on\\nthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often\\ncausing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in\\ntechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.\\n\\nThe Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as\\nwell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for\\nlightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back\\nto ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded\\nobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses\\nquickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the\\ndwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it\\nflows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause\\ncorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,\\nand it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop\\nbetween the \"hot\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the\\nwater pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. \\n(don\\'t flame ME on this, I\\'m just telling you where the field comes from, not\\nit\\'s health effect, as far as I\\'m concerned, the jury is still out on this.)\\n\\nNote that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any\\nsub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service\\nentrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have\\na seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this\\napplication only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the\\ngrounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding\\nscrew, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above\\nground, with the possible problems listed above.\\n\\nThe code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one\\nbuilding to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be\\nused as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate\\nwire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. \\nThese exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days\\nbefore U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don\\'t want to\\nhave to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don\\'t want to\\nhave to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place\\nof three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate\\nneutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings\\n(since most current is in the 220 volt \"hots\" except at some low settings, the\\nwires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. \\nSo far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,\\nit\\'s primarily for lightning protection.\\n\\nPeople doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn\\'t a legal grounding\\nconductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \"romex\" \\'with ground\\' is.  Anywhere\\nthere is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good\\ngrounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes\\nis a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under\\nthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this\\naluminum band off at the ends, you don\\'t have to bond it to anything, it does\\nits job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall\\ntubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding\\nlocknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  \\n\\n\"Greenfield\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty\\nsheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn\\'t have\\nthe aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and\\ninductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the\\ngreenfield.\\n\\n\"Wiremold\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes\\noften prevents good contact, and the \"feed\" to the wiremold extension is often\\nfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold\\nbox.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and\\nthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \"hot\" with\\n120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator\\nhere in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one\\nof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a\\nground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in\\nthe original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \"bond\" the wire to the\\nbox with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.\\n\\nOn another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets\\nwhen ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them\\nwithout a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the\\nprotection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don\\'t\\ninstall it.  The interrupter doesn\\'t depend on the ground to trip.  It is\\ndesirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is\\nconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,\\nwhereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something\\nprovides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded\\nGCFI\\'s, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my \\'93\\ncode is in the city, but I know the rule hasn\\'t changed.  It might be\\nrenumbered though.) \\n\\nWe have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more\\nto this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.  \\n\\nJohn\\n-- \\n*******************************************************************************\\nJohn H.

Some new\\ndrives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data\\nwrites. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform\\na test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical\\ntolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some*\\ntrack drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it.

The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas\\nthe upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700\\nupgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21\"\\nwith 8 bit depth and up to 16\" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It\\nalso has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which\\nmakes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.\\n\\n  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you\\'re\\nbetter off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an\\naccelerator.\\n\\nPaul\\n',\n",

The sermon was\\nbased on a story in the Book of Joshua.  (The one about Joshua sending out\\nspies to the land he was planning to take)  What I particularly remember,\\nbecause of having heard part of a CBC radio documentary on Bosnia, was that\\nthe Rahab (the woman who sheltered the spies) said that the people were\\n\"melting in fear.\"  What with having heard that CBC radio documentary and\\nknowing that the Muslims in Bosnia were losing the war, I felt\\nuncomfortable.  After all, the Serbs are driving non-Christians out.  On\\nthe other hand, ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the values\\nheld by our secular society.  Anyhow members of that church are involved in\\nout-of-country missionary work.  Also, the pastor has talked of spiritual\\nwarfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area.\\n\\nThe next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelites\\ntake Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except\\nfor Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports about\\nBosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that\\nthe massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered\\nme was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I\\nshouldn\\'t be so troubled about the reports of \"ethnic cleansing\" in\\nBosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn\\'t be with the Moslims.\\nConsidering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians\\nwho, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing\\nGod\\'s work?\\n\\n[The example of God\\'s people setting out on bloody wars of conquest\\nhas always been troubling in discussions here.  I personally question\\nwhether they were right even at the time.  But those who believe they\\nwere consider that the wars were justified only because they were\\nspecifically commanded by God.  Somehow I don\\'t see the Serbs behaving\\nlike a group that is led by God in this matter.  --clh]\\n',\n",

Friday local Tel Aviv\\'s\\npaper, affiliated with Maariv.\\n\\nDate: 19 February 1993\\n\\nJournalist: Guy Ehrlich\\n\\nSubject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan\\n(Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate\\nwithin the occupied territories.\\n\\nExcerpts from the article:\\n\\n\"A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as\\nArabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most\\nimportant problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is\\nthat everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one\\nway or another insane\".\\n\\nA man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name\\nis known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge\\nfrom the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be\\ncalled Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to\\ndepart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different\\nfrom average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript\\nservice. But in their souls, one can notice something completely\\ndifferent....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures\\nabout what happened to them. And they think that to most of their\\nfellows from the Cherry it woundn\\'t be easy either. Yet after they\\nbegan to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking.\\nThe following article will contain all the horror stories\\nrecounted with an appalling openness.\\n\\n(...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in\\nwhich some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We\\ncalled such soldiers H.I. \\'Hit by the Intifada\\'. Under my command\\nwas a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common\\nphenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I\\nshould talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On\\nFridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to\\nuntil I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The\\nkeys of my father\\'s car must be ready for in advance, so that I\\ncan go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don\\'t\\nwant them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it\\ninstantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time\\nand then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only\\nthere I become normal.(...)\\n\\n(...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother.\\nIt was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to\\nme and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which\\nwas still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how\\nexactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began\\nto laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh\\nstraight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a\\nmincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov\\ncocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as\\nthey deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with\\nthe effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I\\nwas delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the\\nArab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit\\nhim straight in his ass. We both felt that we\\'d pulled off\\nsomething.\\n\\nNext I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts\\nin the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that\\nspot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab,\\nblood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: \\'Shut\\nup\\' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed\\nstraight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at\\nsomething convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: \\'All\\nright, wait a moment\\'. I left him in order to take a look at\\nanother wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be\\nsaved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the\\nhelp of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all\\nthis to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight\\ninto my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt\\nI was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he\\nomelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over\\nher head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn\\'t know\\nwhat to say.\\n\\n(...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls\\nupon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a\\nfield. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend\\nshot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the\\nhill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it.\\nWe enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two\\ndeer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we\\nsaw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to\\nsuch some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully\\ninspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of\\nthe two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We\\nhad hit\\'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too,\\nso as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my\\nrevolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short\\ndistance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the\\nbullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall\\noutside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of\\nblood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our\\nmadness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like\\nbeasts of prey. We couldn\\'t explain what had happened to us. We\\nwere almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we\\nfelt the whole day very badly.\\n\\n(...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in.\\nThis is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may\\nbe for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel\\nGodlike of sorts.\"\\n\\n(...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment\\nstudying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any\\nsecurity-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. \\'Why\\nshouldn\\'t I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ?\\nWhy shouldn\\'t I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver\\nwhile being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suits\\nme perfectly. I have no human emotions any more. If I get a\\nreasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane to\\nBosnia in order to fight there.\"\\n\\nTransl. by Israel Shahak.\\n\\n',\n",

These aren\\'t, in a strict sense, amateur rockets. That term\\ndenotes rockets, the engines of which are constructed by the user. The\\nrockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, to\\ndistinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-made\\nammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines\\nwith graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A \"D\"\\nengine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse.\\nAn \"F\" engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to a\\ndoubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size \"O\" are\\navailable pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above are\\nshipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines of\\nsize F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not as\\ncontrolled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocket\\nengines. (Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo.)\\n\\nThere is an HPR Society, The Tripoli Rocket Society, I believe, which\\nholds events at various sites throughout the year, with all legalities\\n(FAA waiver included) taken care of. The National Association of\\nRocketry is more concerned with engines below H, though it is involved\\nin HPR as well. These societies certify users of HPR rockets, and\\ncompanies will not sell to uncertified individuals.\\n\\nBottom Line: It\\'s legit. I suggest you send for a catalog - but forget\\nthe dynamite, will ya?\\n\\n-Larry C.\\n',\n",

Space Science\\nDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail\\nproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to\\ngenerate interest in the project. I\\'ll typein the handout he gave out at\\nthe meeting. Here goes : \\n\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Microlight Solar Sail\\n\\t\\t\\t-------------------------\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of\\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a\\nvehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\\n\\nHowever it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\\npeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\\nsquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\\nfabric which would be necessary to transport a \\'conventional\\' type\\nspacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte\\nidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\\n\\n2.Design\\nRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a\\ntiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely\\nbe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control\\nmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a\\npanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.\\n\\nThe key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at\\nEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data\\ngathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and\\ncommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface\\nof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of\\nthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.\\n\\n3.Missions\\nThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:\\na) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor\\ngroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit\\nrate.\\nb) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved\\nareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to\\nreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive\\nsunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that\\nvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these\\nlocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar\\nbase, BTW]\\nc) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet\\nnucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft\\ncauses it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged\\ntube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an\\nideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat\\nis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300\\ndeg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating\\ncontainer.\\n\\nContact: Colin Jack                              Tel. 0865-200447\\nOxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThis guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project or\\nseeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you more\\ninformation.\\n\\n\\tAndy\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\n                                  ----------------------------------- \\nAndy Jonathan J.

The OT game winner came from Dimitri\\nYushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS\\nnever led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an\\nNHL record 9th OT loss this season.\\n\\nRoster move:\\n\\nGord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill\\n\\nInjuries:\\n\\nRyan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.\\n\\nLines:\\n\\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\\nFaust-Acton-Brown\\n\\nGalley-Bowen\\nYushkevich-Hawgood\\nCarkner-Hynes\\n\\nDominic Roussel\\n\\nGame Summary:\\n\\nI didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts\\nI didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by\\na few things I did pick up:\\n\\nFirst Period:\\n\\tHartford, Nylander 10, 8:51\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)\\nPenalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,\\nHar (interference) 18:43\\n\\nSecond Period:\\n\\tHartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09\\n\\tHartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38\\nPenalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har\\nmajor-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,\\nHar (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50\\n\\nThird Period:\\n\\tHartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38\\nPenalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30\\n\\nOvertime:\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.\\nPenalties - None\\n\\nPower Play:\\n\\tPhiladelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4\\n\\nGoalies:\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)\\n\\tHartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)\\n\\nOn the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue\\nline and Nylander stripped him and took off.\\n\\nThe Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.\\n\\nThe Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it\\nended up behind the goalie.\\n\\nOn the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.\\nThis is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if\\nthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,\\nGalley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of\\nthem was the closest FLYER to the play.\\n\\nThat's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it\\nwas that scored, much less how.\\n\\nFrom what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart\\nasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the\\ngame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised\\nthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy \\nSoderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season\\nand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.\\nBut here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for\\nnumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between\\nhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????\\n\\nWhat? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...\\n\\n#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.\\nThe difference between the team's record with him and without him is no\\naccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without\\nRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric\\nLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey\\nnext season.\\n\\n#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,\\nand Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't\\nplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family\\nhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy\\nSoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again\\nabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.\\n\\n#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season\\nscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player\\nget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.\\nNot a tough choice.\\n\\nHonorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total\\nwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line\\nthis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the\\ndefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.\\n\\nDimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie\\nmistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling\\nthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up\\nanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman\\nin years to come.\\n\\nGarry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some\\nthings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,\\nhe certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his\\nwishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive\\ncontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end\\nwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.\\n\\nBrent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.\\nBut consistency became a problem for him.\\n\\nA couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:\\n\\nTom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mail\\naddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.\\nIf you're interested, you can send him mail at:\\n\\natt!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK\\n\\nThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning\\npercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in\\nPatrick), 23-14-5 at home.

I played\\nElvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally made\\na very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel is\\nroughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real time\\nfighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games,\\nespecially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to\\nstay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This \\nis not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is\\nquite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found\\nthat is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting\\nstrategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is \\nno fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain\\nmoderately challanging puzzles.\\n\\nThe really interesting thing about this game is that it is really \\nbroken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits\\nyou must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transported\\nwith no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits traps\\nyou inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must \\nescape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibit\\ntraps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines\\nand pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant\\nzombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue\\nsome humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill\\nthe very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is\\nperhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into\\nJack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper\\nvictim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must\\navoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and \\nmeet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibit\\npus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to \\nstop the almost indestructible zombies.  \\n\\nOver all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a \\ncreepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, though\\ngameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game.\\nI heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.   \\n\\n*********************************************************\\n\\n- All prices include shipping.\\n- All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated.\\n- US buyers only please.\\n- All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,\\n  priority USPS.\\n- All games include all original materials including box, manual,\\n  disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.\\n\\nThe first responder offering asking price is guarenteed to\\nget the game.

The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \"The Abyss.\" \\nBefore the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at \\nthe City Party Committee, but they were silent, there\\'s no conversation \\nwhatsoever, and we couldn\\'t figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it \\nwas about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if \\nsomeone gave a speech or not, we didn\\'t know. We bought our tickets. There \\nwere 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that \\nlarge movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the\\nfilm. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well \\nmostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an \\nArmenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that \\nthey were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do \\nto Armenian girls. I thought that\\'s what they meant because they had demanded \\na girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move \\nover, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone \\nrecognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. \\nIt got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it\\'s\\nonly opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. \\nEveryone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, \\npeople of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the \\nauditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and \\ngradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \"OK, we\\'ve \\nscared them enough, let\\'s leave.\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to \\nme that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of \\n\"anasha\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like \\nthey were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing \\nhad happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful \\nfilms which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We \\ncould barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, \\nand it was dark . . .\\n\\nMarina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that\\'s the center of town. Lenin\\nStreet was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, \\nsomething about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren\\'t especially \\nlistening, because the way we were feeling we didn\\'t know if we were going to \\nmake it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation \\nwasn\\'t running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, \\npolicemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the\\ndoors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors \\nthere are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-\\nstricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some \\nnaughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, \\nsince he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super \\nserious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we \\nlive literally one stop away. We didn\\'t want to go on foot, not because it was\\ndark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the \\ndriver didn\\'t want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and \\nhe said he\\'d take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, \\nOK . . .\\n\\nSo we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was \\nhappening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation \\nwas at a standstill and everyone was shouting \"Ka-ra-bagh,\" they\\'re not going \\nto give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what\\'s going on, and there\\'s\\nimmediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had \\ncome, they were going to come, kill us, that\\'s it . . . Somehow we managed to \\ncheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,\\njust what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma \\ndown. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though \\nnothing had happened.\\n\\nThat was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn\\'t go anywhere and \\ndidn\\'t call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.\\nThat day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn\\'t\\nguess.\\n\\nOn the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always\\nhad. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, \\nMarina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and \\nno one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that \\nmorning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at\\nhome and didn\\'t know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda \\nZimogliad, came by at around three o\\'clock I think. We worked together, we did\\nour apprenticeships together, she\\'s a Russian girl. She said that something\\nawful was happening in town. I asked, \"Don\\'t they want Armenians? Well what \\nare they after, if they\\'re already in that state?\" She says, no, nothing like \\nthat, it\\'s just a demonstration, but it\\'s awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels\\nlike a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The \\ncabs, the buses, well it\\'s just a nightmare.\\n\\nThen Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy \\nproblems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,\\nasked him, \"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going\\non in the courtyard; aren\\'t you afraid to go out?\" Papa didn\\'t know what she\\nwas talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home \\nand told Mamma. Mamma said, \"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means\\nthat something is really going on.\" But we didn\\'t go see her, she\\'s a Russian,\\nshe lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o\\'clock I \\ntell Lyuda, \"Ok, look, it\\'s time for you to go, it\\'s late already, I\\'ll see \\nyou out.\" Mamma says, \"You don\\'t need to go, it\\'s too late already, you can \\nsee what the situation in town is.\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was \\nready. Mamma says, \"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\" We sat down at the \\ntable. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything \\nout on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we\\'re eating.\\nWe turned on the television, and the show \"In Fairy-Tale Land\" was coming on. \\nWe cleared the table.\\n\\nWe hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can\\'t \\nsee what\\'s going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus\\nstation, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people \\n. . . I can\\'t figure out what\\'s happening. They\\'re shouting something, looking\\nsomewhere, I can\\'t make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she\\'s \\nan Azerbaijani; we\\'ve been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down\\nto look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story \\nbuildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 \\npeople, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see \\nseveral people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide\\nthat means it\\'s not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they\\'re not \\nkilling anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of \\nthe soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their \\nfeet, everyone\\'s kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in \\ngeneral terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can\\'t speak\\n. . . Well, they\\'ve probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .\\nIf each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him\\nand started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn\\'t see if he\\ngot up and left or not.\\n\\nI become terrified and go home and say, \"Lyuda, don\\'t go anywhere, stay at our\\nplace, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \" Then the crowd \\nruns over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and \\nstarts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors \\nare also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is \\nshouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it \\nturns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and \\nkept them from coming in. There\\'s only one entryway there, they could stop \\nthem.\\n\\nThey all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,\\nafraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the \\nwindows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, \\nand it\\'s packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don\\'t \\ncrush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It\\'s just a huge\\ncloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey \\nSargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear \\ntramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous \\ndin and roar. It\\'s incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were \\nshouting Father\\'s name, \"Grisha, open the door, we\\'ve come to kill you!,\" or\\nsomething like that. I don\\'t remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma \\nsays, \"Into the bedroom, quickly!\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part \\nof our dowry; Mamma says, \"Hide there, they probably won\\'t come in there, \\nthey\\'ll ask something, say something, and leave.\" She says, \"We\\'ll tell them \\nthat we live alone here.\" I can\\'t imagine that my parents will stand out in \\nthe hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say \\nthat I\\'ll stand together with them, I\\'ll talk with them if they come, maybe I \\ncan find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak \\nAzerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and\\nLyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can\\'t remember if I told \\nher anything or not.\\n\\nThen . . . they open the door: it\\'s like they blew on it and it broke and fell\\nright into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,\\nleave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I\\ntell them, \"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what\\nhas happened.\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \"Get out of the apartment, leave.\" I \\nsay, \"OK. Go downstairs. We\\'ll gather everything we need and leave the \\napartment.\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with\\nthem, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the\\ndoorway, the young guys, say, \"There are old people and one girl with them.\\nToo bad!\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have\\npacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, \\ncommanding them: \"Don\\'t you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\"\\n\\nAnd that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one\\nroom, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start \\nundressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, \\nin front of Mamma. I don\\'t remember where they went, what they did, or how \\nmuch time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,\\nand tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don\\'t even know what I said. The \\natrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among \\nthemselves who would go first.\\n\\nLater, I remember, I came to. I don\\'t know if I\\'m dead or alive. Someone comes\\nin, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. \\nHe looks around at what\\'s happening. At that instant everything stops. It \\nseems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything\\ndepends on him. He looks and says, \"Well, we\\'re done here.\" They are beating\\nMamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs \\n. . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she\\'s dead. Papa . . . was\\nout cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can\\'t get the \\nwindow open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the \\nwindows can\\'t be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking \\nabout being thrown out the window and passed out. She\\'s not a real strong \\nperson anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I\\'m saying something, that\\nI\\'m still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, \\nwhich is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they \\ndon\\'t get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I\\'m dead, why would I \\nhumble myself before anyone? And he says that if that\\'s what I think, since my\\ntongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing \\n. . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.\\n\\nI no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don\\'t \\nknow if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by \\nmy arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, \\nsomething metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone\\nelse is pinching me . . .I don\\'t even know. I think, my God, when will death \\ncome? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near\\nthe entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What \\nhappened after that, how many people there were, I don\\'t remember.\\n \\nI come to after a while, I don\\'t remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me \\nclothing. I\\'m entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember \\nthat I said the same words over and over again: \"Mamma, what happened, Mamma, \\nwhat have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\" I can\\'t make \\nsense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he\\nserved in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all \\nwent to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his \\ncourage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors\\', even though \\nhe\\'s small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he \\nserved in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served\\nthere, I think; now he\\'s stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor \\nbrought me to the neighbors\\', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, \\n\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I\\'m not one of them.\" How do I know who\\'s who \\nand what\\'s what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then\\nPapa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when \\nthey dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda \\nsaid that she was Russian, they said, we\\'ll let you go, we aren\\'t touching the\\nRussians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she\\'s going \\nto tell them she\\'s Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina\\'s and Lyuda\\'s \\nhands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our \\nsister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor\\'s and starts pounding \\non the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in \\nthere. So they survived.\\n\\nMy sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.\\nWhile they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back \\nup again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed \\nthere. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put \\nit on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor\\'s on the fourth floor, the\\none whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and \\nknocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \"I\\'m not going to let you \\nin the apartment because I\\'m afraid of them. But I\\'ll give you some stockings \\nand we\\'ll leave the building.\" Lyuda says, \"I\\'ll stay at your place because of\\nwhat\\'s going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\" It was just for a \\nmoment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn\\'t consent. Lyuda came \\nback to our place and lay under the bed . . .\\n\\nI came to. Mother was there. I can\\'t remember my supervisor\\'s telephone \\nnumber, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he \\ncame to get us. He didn\\'t have any idea what was going on. He thought we were \\nsimply afraid, he didn\\'t know that they were killing us and that we had passed\\nbetween life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.\\nThere they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, \\nit was hard to breathe . . .\\n\\nMy supervisor\\'s name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He\\'s the head of our \\nadministration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number\\nof buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary \\npassenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right \\nafter eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a \\ngreat many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and\\nwhat was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not \\nonly in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, \\nwithout stopping. After us.\\n\\nI think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from\\nBuildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died\\nfrom Building 16, that\\'s the building in front of ours. There young \\nAzerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn\\'t let it into their building. \\nIncidentally, when we were at the neighbors\\', Marina called our relatives\\nto warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in \\nMicrodistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \"Run\\nquickly, I can\\'t explain what\\'s going on; hide, do what you can, just stay\\nalive. Hide at Azerbaijanis\\', ones who won\\'t give you away.\" At that moment \\nthree people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such\\nawful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, \\nthere was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything \\nout of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face\\nwas pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my\\nnormal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to \\nscream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you \\nhere, haven\\'t you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of \\nthe soldiers said, \"Don\\'t scream at us. We\\'re Muslims, but we\\'re not from the \\nSumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\" So at that point the \\nDaghestan police were there.\\n\\nWhen we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,\\nthere were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don\\'t know,\\nmaybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously \\ninjured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don\\'t know what they \\nwere there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda \\nand me and said, \"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don\\'t \\nknow what to do with the rest.\"\\n\\nSo they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My \\nboss said, \"Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll find you, no matter where you are, no matter\\nwhat happens.\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department\\nhead from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She \\nexamined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait \\nambulances hadn\\'t done anything, they didn\\'t respond to any calls. People \\ncalled and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.\\n\\nThat doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something\\nvery good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, \\n\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\" She looks me over and \\nsays, \"Now why are you suffering so? You don\\'t know what your people have been\\ndoing, your people did even worse things.\" And I think, great, I have to deal \\nwith her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don\\'t I just die so as not to\\nhave to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this \\ncondition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn\\'t \\nhave the energy to say, \"How could our people possibly be smart enough to \\nthink of something that yours haven\\'t already done?\" I stayed there. Then they\\nbrought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her \\nown apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next \\nmorning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn\\'t do anything to help us. This\\nwas in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn\\'t do anything \\nmore than examine me, that was it. I didn\\'t want any shots or tranquilizer, \\nnothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn\\'t even want to look at \\nthem.\\n\\nI lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-\\npose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That\\nsame evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face\\nwas disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \"Better to ask \\nyour brother what happened, there\\'s no point in asking me, your brother can \\nbetter explain what happened.\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw \\nthemselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my\\nward.\\n\\nThen people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me \\nclothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, \\nbut the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up \\nabove my knees, and the woman orderly said, \"I can\\'t believe you put on such a\\nshort dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\" I went back to my \\nward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and \\nbrought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I \\ncouldn\\'t take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said\\nthat I couldn\\'t take the apples, and really didn\\'t have any appetite. No one \\nhad to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . \\nThen I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should \\nbe hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an \\nArmenian, maybe they wouldn\\'t figure it out from looking at me. So they must \\nhave been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something \\nelse would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on\\nthe street, I don\\'t know. In any case, I didn\\'t sleep a wink that night.\\n\\nThe next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, \\nand off we went. I didn\\'t even know where they were taking me. They took me to\\nthe club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.\\nI got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many \\ntroops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw \\na few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought \\nthat I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait \\nafter that night. I still didn\\'t know what happened to my parents, they didn\\'t \\ncome to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. \\nI didn\\'t know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm \\nme down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw \\na lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each \\nother and asking, \"What happened, what went on?\" Two days later they came to \\nsee me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed \\ninterest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they \\ncould. Of course I\\'m most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues \\nwho didn\\'t lose his presence of mind and who didn\\'t change his opinions, \\nneither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what \\nhappened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart \\n. . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, \\nnot from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part \\nof, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements\\nwith the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by\\nmyself I couldn\\'t get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my\\nlungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I \\nlay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be \\nfrom all the blows, I don\\'t know. They didn\\'t diagnose anything in particular.\\nWhen I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of \\ninsisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. \\nThere was no way something inside wasn\\'t broken, my ribs . . . Well they took \\nme there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were \\nemergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina\\'s \\nfriends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children\\'s Clinic. \\nThey had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I\\nneeded at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty\\nbreathing, I couldn\\'t seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.\\nThey put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some\\npeople saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all\\nbandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I\\nwasn\\'t cut.\\n\\nThey took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon \\nappeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not \\ntalk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \"We \\ndemand that Seidov come!\" The response was, \"It\\'s Seidov who sent us.\" Seidov \\nis the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, \\n\"We\\'ll only see Seidov\\'s daughter, have her come here, we\\'ll do the same \\nthings to her that they did to our daughters, and then we\\'ll deal with you \\nagitators.\" And so on. More of them said, \"Have Seidov himself come.\" This \\nwent on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us \\nout of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because \\nthey realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The \\nsmell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who \\nhad literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a \\nclub that didn\\'t even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay \\nto eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day \\nsomeone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.\\nEverything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie \\ntheater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn\\'t sit or lie down, it \\nwas impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants \\ntook ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in \\nYerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to \\nmention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting \\nright and left. I just don\\'t know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only \\nthe young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women \\nwere in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come \\nany minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered \\ntogether purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie \\ntheater and there wouldn\\'t be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to \\nthe attic. I didn\\'t see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and \\ncouldn\\'t get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently \\nthey caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the\\ntheater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn\\'t. I was in no condition to open my \\neyes.\\n\\nEveryone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \"Aren\\'t you an \\nAzerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you\\'re an Azerbaijani.\" They\\nled out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their\\npassports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did\\nnot have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in \\nnothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like\\nthey should have, with their IDs.\\n\\nSo on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On\\nMonday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn\\'t \\nspare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,\\nthey burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered \\nthe Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-\\nin-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only \\nthe two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, \\nshe ran away, the neighbors wouldn\\'t take her in, so she ran about the \\nbuilding until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. \\nThis all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were \\nalready in the city.\\n\\nThey murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire \\nfamilies. They say they didn\\'t even know for sure if the people were Armenians\\nor not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I\\'m not sure myself, I didn\\'t \\nsee any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it\\'s very difficult \\nnow to say exactly who died and who didn\\'t. It was very difficult to identify \\nthe corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in\\ngasoline and burned . . . it\\'s all very hard to imagine, of course I heard \\nthat many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, \\nincluding a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in\\nMicrodistrict 3.\\n\\nThey were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who \\nhad been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were \\ngoing home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply \\nsavagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did \\nwhat they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that \\nhoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians\\nout and killed them on the spot. I didn\\'t see it myself, but I heard that they\\nput them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from \\nthe corpses, well you can\\'t call them corpses, you had to figure out from the \\nashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira\\nG., if I\\'m not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and \\nshe still can\\'t figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and \\nbeaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that \\nwhole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and \\ncarried her to the city. I still can\\'t imagine how he managed to do that.\\n\\nI heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of \\npeople went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a \\nsong in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has \\nthat piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, \\nthe one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They \\ncouldn\\'t find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone\\'s apartment and\\ncalled the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,\\nshe couldn\\'t remember anyone\\'s face.\\n\\nI think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had \\ntalked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked\\nout of my head. I can\\'t remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw\\nthe Secretary of the Directorate\\'s Party organization, where Marina works. She\\ngoes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at\\nthe Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I\\'m the \\nSecretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met \\nwith the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint \\nmeetings. I know them all, I\\'ve even talked with them, and he, I know, is from\\nArmenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of \\nthose people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.\\n\\nThey took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the\\nProcuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-\\ntified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They\\nshowed me the people who were in our apartment, they\\'re working on our\\ncase, but I can\\'t even recognize them, although it was proved that they were\\nthe ones, they\\'re processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that\\nsomeone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were \\ndragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch \\nme, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these \\npeople, all of them, as much as I\\'ve heard about them and seen them, they were\\nall from Kafan.\\n\\nThe Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was \\nthere when everything started. It must have been him because I didn\\'t \\nrecognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since\\nI told him, \"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\" He turned away \\nand went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn\\'t see Marina \\nanyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn\\'t make out \\nanyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became \\nmyself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people \\nthere. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his \\nname. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one \\nwe\\'re part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \"If\\nhe\\'s here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his \\nalibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I\\'m crazy, not \\nresponsible for my words.\" He said, \"What did they do to you, how awful, \\nmyself, I hid an Armenian family.\" Then after some time goes by he comes back \\nagain and says something entirely different: \"I wasn\\'t at home, my family and \\nI went to Baku.\" I said, \"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally\\ndifferent before.\" After that I didn\\'t go to see our Procurator, our case is \\nbeing handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me \\nthat Rzayev\\'s case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. \\nWhat are they doing with Rzayev?\\nDid he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the \\nhead I can\\'t say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an \\ninsult if he was in our apartment and doesn\\'t have to pay for it, but at the \\nsame time\\n\\nI\\'m afraid to say I\\'m a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-\\nter who I name, they tell me, no, you\\'re wrong, he didn\\'t do that, that one\\nwasn\\'t there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what\\nexactly I can\\'t say.                                                     \\n\\nWhen they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn\\'t see it, \\nbecause I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got\\nit because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it \\nalways seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my \\nface I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, \\nthey took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he\\nworks at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, \\nis where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ \\ndormitory is over there, that\\'s where he lives. Now he\\'s in custody, they even\\nhave proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the\\nclarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our \\nbuilding was killed, it was that man.\\n\\nA guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that\\nhe was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn\\'t come \\nover, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was \\nall over, people started making announcements in town saying that \\ninvestigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now \\nthey\\'ve caught him, everything\\'s been proved. Now, evidently, they\\'ve been\\nbeating him, I don\\'t know what they\\'re doing with them over there, but he \\nhimself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy \\ncame to the plant and said, \"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the \\nbus station on Saturday at ten.\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,\\nwent. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday\\nnight. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do \\nyou mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, \\nprobably, in their hearts they were thinking, I\\'m going to go. But they didn\\'t\\nsay anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, \\nbecause he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had \\nkilled their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of \\nthat. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that \\nthe Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from\\n\\nI\\'ve participated in the investigation a couple of times. I\\'m satisfied with\\nthem thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word \\nI said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an \\nArmenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don\\'t know. \\nHis last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from \\nMicrodistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. \\nHis mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani \\nKGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many \\nphotographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at \\ncurfew, and I\\'ve got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, \\nthe guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off\\nand burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a \\nhaystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he \\nis so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don\\'t know what he did, \\nI can\\'t remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. \\nAt the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there\\'s no need for this, \\nall this stuff, look me in the eyes, you\\'re like a sister to me. I took a look\\nat him and thought, \"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like \\nyou.\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything \\nwithout great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when \\nshe came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over\\nthe table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the\\nbalcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had \\nall kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. \\nThey stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that \\nmoment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the \\nfaces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the \\napartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I\\'ve got three kids and \\nno place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn\\'t have \\nanywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the \\napartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the \\napartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That\\'s what they said. How did they \\nknow there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that\\nArmenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the \\nbuilding, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis \\nlived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn\\'t set fire to our \\napartment.\\n\\nI don\\'t know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt \\nwhen I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would\\nhave said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but\\nprobably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw\\nthat all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at\\na free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were\\nbeing fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have\\nbeen fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from \\nour building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \"Karina, we \\nsaw all of it, how could it happen?\" They\\'re asking me! Well I just don\\'t know\\nwhat to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to \\nme. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn\\'t have been \\nable to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani \\nwoman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated \\nwoman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two \\nArmenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the\\nbalcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She \\ncame down to the entryway and said, \"You\\'ll come in this entryway over my dead\\nbody.\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some \\nfolks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn\\'t \\neven know what they were doing. I don\\'t think that\\'s true. They knew very well\\nwhat they were doing if they didn\\'t even lift a hand against that woman. They \\ncouldn\\'t have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani \\nstopped them.\\n\\nThey were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place \\nthey were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the \\napartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? \\nMaybe I\\'m losing my mind? But no, they\\'re all chewing something. Maybe it is \\nsome kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed \\nto be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had \\ncome to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They\\ndidn\\'t talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They \\nscreamed and screamed: \"Yeah, killing, killing, we\\'re killing the Armenians!\" \\nOnly they didn\\'t shout \"kill,\" they shouted \"gurun ermianlary.\" Gurun \\nliterally means \"kill,\" or \"destroy.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s how it was! I\\'ll continue. We hid in a captain\\'s apartment, he\\'s an\\nAzerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their \\nkids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part \\nof the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn\\'t find\\nLyuda she took Papa\\'s hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,\\nbut they didn\\'t pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently\\nthey had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the\\ncourage to . . .\\n\\nA boy said to my mother \"Where\\'s the gold?\" Mamma said he must have been 12 \\nto 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the \\nAzerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the \\nfair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where \\nthe gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a \\nlittle black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn\\'t really like to \\nwear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were \\nbought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma\\nthinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and \\nMamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, \\nbound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had \\nshoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and \\ntore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having \\ntrouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and \\nstarted running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted \\nto open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by \\naccident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, \\n\"What\\'s happened?\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \"At least go and \\nfind out what\\'s happening to my daughters, even if they\\'ve burned them or \\nmurdered them, at least bring the corpses.\" He went looking for us. At that \\nmoment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that \\nsomeone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn\\'t get out \\nfrom under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought \\nshe was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to \\nherself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from \\nunder the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost\\nher mind. I\\'ll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that \\nway to me, I\\'ll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled \\ndown, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from\\noutside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don\\'t remember what order it\\nhappened in.\\n\\nAnd Mamma said, \"Listen, they\\'re all running around down there, shouting \\nsomething or other, and running toward the other building.\" It had more or \\nless calmed down where we were. Who\\'s dead, who\\'s alive, we don\\'t know. I \\ntried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \"Listen;\\nlet\\'s go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don\\'t know how \\nlong we\\'ll be here. Maybe they didn\\'t burn everything.\" I don\\'t get it, all\\nwomen have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe \\nnot everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \"Mamma, what do you need any of that \\nfor? To hell with it! We\\'re alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\" She\\nsays, \"No, let\\'s go get at least something. Maybe we\\'ll leave here, spend the \\nnight at someone else\\'s.\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son\\nAlik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were \\ncoming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He \\nshouts, \"Come back, they\\'re coming!\" They didn\\'t have enough time to get a \\nlot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my \\nknitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,\\nout of the hall . . . Someone took Father\\'s old coveralls. The neighbor, his \\nwife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to \\nleave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and\\njust then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, \\nthey\\'re dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, \\nmaybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over\\nthere, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished \\nbuilding, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more \\nor less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.\\n\\nLater there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom\\napartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,\\nAsya Dallakian. She\\'s an old woman, retired. She wasn\\'t at home, at that\\ntime she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and\\nher grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her\\nretirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started\\npounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, \\nsomething like that, she\\'s a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even \\nlive there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and \\nmattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. \\nThey started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \"My \\nGod, what is going on around here? When will this end?\" We turned off the \\nlights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren\\'t afraid, the ones who \\nknew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn\\'t know, but \\nthey didn\\'t come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that \\nhe was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his \\napartment. His last name was Kasumov. He\\'s an exserviceman, retired, works up \\nat the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.\\nThey tell him, \"Comrade Captain, don\\'t worry, we won\\'t harm you, you\\'re one of\\nus.\" He went upstairs, and they say, \"Aren\\'t you taking anything from this \\napartment?\" He says, \"I don\\'t need anything.\" And the women who were standing \\nin the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were \\nstanding in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the \\nfirst floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time \\nto into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty \\npillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really \\nmad, and he says, \"Where\\'s the rug? I just put it right here!\" They tell him, \\n\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\" He ran off in that\\ndirection.\\n\\nOh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, \\nthere were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They \\njust didn\\'t tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, \\nshe didn\\'t want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told \\nme, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, \\nthe ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \"Where\\'s the girl who was here?\"\\nAnd he became furious. The woman tells him, \"She came to . . . \" She didn\\'t\\nknow what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would\\ncomb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \"She\\ncame to and went to the basement.\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the \\nwhole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took \\nflashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been \\nstanding there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there \\nto get me. Then one of them said, \"There\\'s so much water down there, she \\nprobably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in \\nthe basement. That\\'s it, we can leave, no problem!\" I didn\\'t know that, and \\nwhen I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn\\'t \\njust want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .\\n\\nAfter that we of course didn\\'t want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really \\ndidn\\'t want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and \\nstarted to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. \\nAlthough the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people \\nwho sat in their apartments and didn\\'t help us at a time like that. I think \\nthat they could have helped! I don\\'t think that they were obligated to, but \\nthey could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole \\nbrutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been\\nenough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you\\'re doing?\" That\\'s \\nall! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not \\none person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were \\nstanding on their balconies I didn\\'t hear anyone\\'s voice, no one said what are\\nyou doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women \\nthat if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a\\nbomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for \\none of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, \\nan old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: \\nif a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed \\nto stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they\\nstomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \"If\\nyou want to go on living, you\\'ll disappear into your apartment.\" So she left.\\nThat trick didn\\'t work on them.\\n\\nEven the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget \\nthat it happened. I said I\\'d only forget it if I told them right then that it\\nhad happened to their daughter--and if that didn\\'t have any effect on them, \\nthen I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. \\nAnd no one did anything.

Too weird for me.\\nThe MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went.\\nThe Celica was \"ok\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat\\noverpriced too) in non-turbo form.\\nI never considered the 240SX since it didn\\'t have an airbag.  I did look at it\\nfor its RWD virtues but that\\'s it.  The Corolla never entered my mind.\\nI should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more.\\nSince my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)\\n\\nThe car design is different than earlier years, so it\\'s too early to see its\\nreliability so far.  For what it\\'s worth, my comments:\\n\\nMy dislikes:\\nShutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.\\nHeadlights have \"stuck\" up a few times (weather?)\\nair conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)\\ncondensation around rear washer fluid container doesn\\'t drain completely.\\ncrammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)\\nparts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts\\nunderside plastic doesn\\'t like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).\\nassembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not \\nstitched properly.

I\\'m waiting for the day when\\nI bash my head on the corner.\\nhorn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)\\nTires fling dirt/mud onto side of car \\n\\nMy Likes:\\nengine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1\\nhandling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)\\ntransmission (the 5 speed is a must)\\nusable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)\\nVery little torque steer at full power (much better than the \\'90 SHO I drive)\\nstability at 100+mph (high gearing though)\\nlow cowl (good visibility in front)\\nHeated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)\\nABS/Air bag (see above)\\nrear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)\\nNo shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)\\nTires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)\\n\\nAs you can see, I\\'m primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn\\'t\\nhave the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling\\npoint for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  \\n\\nThe overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn\\'t changed\\nmuch since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work\\neach day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the\\nProbe\\'s suspension doesn\\'t like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a \\npotholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.\\nIf you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They\\'ll find\\nthat they have no room in the back and you\\'ll find that the car rides\\ndifferently (if that\\'s \"better\" is up to you).  Also, there\\'s a lot of glass\\naround you which I wasn\\'t expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty\\nhot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about\\nthe lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with\\nthe heat.  I\\'ve heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.\\nLeather and the keyless entry system weren\\'t available when I got the car so\\nI can\\'t comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  \\nI prefer cloth to leather anyway.  \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the\\ninevitable surprise potholes, tires aren\\'t meant for snow, and the seats assume\\nthat you\\'re not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water \\ngenerally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper\\ncontrols are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the\\nEagles (and I was really trying).  \\nThere is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT\\nhas map holders below the speakers in the door, but they\\'re rigid plastic\\nthat could fit two cassettes or CD\\'s max.  The center console/storage bin/arm\\nrest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \"pouch\"\\nbut that\\'s it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO.\\nAnd the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!\\n\\nLastly, don\\'t store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the \\nwater up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.\\n\\nNathan\\nnathan@sco.com\\n\\n>\\n>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n>|Jeremy Mereness                 | Support     | Ye Olde Disclaimer:    |\\n>|zonker+@cmu.edu (internet)      |    Free     |  The above represent my|\\n>| FAST Project, CMU-GSIA         |     Software|   opinions, alone.     |\\n>|B.S.

While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their\\n   highest court \"Supreme Court,\" \"Supreme Judicial Court\" or \"Supreme\\n   Court of Appeals,\" Maryland and New York call theirs simply the\\n   \"Court of Appeals.\"  To make matters worse, New York also calls its\\n   _second-highest_ court the \"Supreme Court, Appellate Division\"...\\n\\nAtlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):\\n\\nOscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company\\'s\\nplant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to\\nwhich came first, the plaintiff\\'s acquisition of the land or he\\ndefendant\\'s start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course\\nof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the\\nplaintiffs\\' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the\\nplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked\\nthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.\\n\\n(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned\\ntheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.\\nAtlantic Cement\\'s actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)\\n\\nInstead of granting the plaintiffs\\' request for an injunction, the court\\nordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided\\nthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In\\nother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the\\npower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment\\nof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is\\nalways problematical even when it\\'s done by the state; allowing a\\nprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.\\n\\n(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn\\'t call it eminent domain.  But if\\nit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks\\nlike eminent domain...)\\n\\nLet me take issue with the way you\\'ve presented the case... you say that\\n\"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn\\'t allow the\\nplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million\\ndollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.\"  Blackmail?\\n\\n    (Pulls out Black\\'s Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....\\n    \"Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to\\n    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose\\n    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under\\n    extortion statutes.\")\\n\\nHow do you define as \"blackmail\" one party\\'s act of demanding the right\\nto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns\\nand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of\\ndemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see\\nit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of\\nowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to\\nstay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price\\nthey wanted.  There isn\\'t, or at least shouldn\\'t be, any law that says\\nthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.\\n\\nYou go on to say: \"The plant would never have been shut down -- the\\nplaintiff\\'s lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,\\nbecause the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to\\nhaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less\\nthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.\"\\n\\nIf so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\\nbusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from\\nother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those\\nother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn\\'t want to have to face a choice\\nbetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,\\nshouldn\\'t Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_\\nbusiness?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_\\nthe parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was\\nAtlantic Cement\\'s own fault for choosing to build and operate the type\\nof plant they did where and when they did.)\\n\\nAnd then you say: \"Everyone\\'s property rights were protected; the\\nplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.\"\\nAs above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were \"made whole.\"\\nThey were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners\\nof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price\\nacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made\\nwhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\\nbusiness of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\\n(If so, I\\'ve been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\\nsupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\\n\\n> Is _Boomer_ really being taught as \"infamous?\"  That\\'s really sad if\\n> it is, because I fail to see how it\\'s less than completely sensible.\\n> You should read the law and economics stuff first-hand instead of\\n> filtered through teachers who clearly don\\'t like it, for whatever\\n> inexplicable reasons.\\n\\n(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as \"infamous,\" at least not at my\\nschool.\\n\\n(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for\\ntheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first\\nencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal\\nopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get\\ninto their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick\\nand choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional\\nResponsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly\\nand self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously\\nintimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly\\nbiased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors\\ntend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is\\nespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are\\npracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_\\neducational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat\\ncloistered scholar.  End of aside.)\\n\\nI called it infamous because that\\'s my opinion of it.  For the reasons\\nI\\'ve stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can\\nonly call \"economic correctness\" over justice.\\n\\n(2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged\\nright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\\nlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\\nthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\\nnot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\\nown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement\\'s wrongful acts.\\n(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other\\nbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take\\nother people\\'s property by eminent domain.)\\n\\n> You\\'d like Posner, Bill.

So it goes.\\n\\nI\\'ve admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to\\nas \"law and economics\" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economical\\nanalysis as one of many \"tie-breaker\" factors which courts may use to\\nhelp them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by\\nthe scale of \"justice\", is evenly balanced, fine.

If we are going to get anywhere in \\nthis (or any) discussion, it doesn\\'t help to bring up elements I never \\naddressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is \\n\"right\" or who is \"wrong\", only that civilians ARE being used as cover \\nand that, having been placed \"in between\" the Israelis and the guerillas,\\nthey *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.\\n \\n\\t[The *purpose* of an army\\'s use of military uniforms \\n\\tis *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that \\n\\tcivilians will not be thought of by the other side as\\n\\t\"combatants\". So, what do you think is the \"meaning behind\", \\n\\tthe intention and the effect when an \"army\" purposely \\n\\t*does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look \\n\\tlike civilians\\'? *They are judging that the benefit they will \\n\\treceive from this \"cover\" is more important that the harm\\n\\tthat will come to civilians.*\\n\\nThis is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying\\nthat the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians\\nin \"the middle\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart\\nfrom civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower\\nthe risk to civilians.\\n\\n\\tBut if the guerillas do this aren\\'t *they* putting themselves\\n\\tat greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \"why set \\n\\tourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made \\n\\tcover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of \\n\\tview, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept \\n\\tsome of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.\\n\\n> If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel, is it not working?

The least it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli \\n> government for the lives of civilians.\\n\\nI agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel\\'s bombing\\nsortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND\\nineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait \\nuntil attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that\\n\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\" will do more to stop attacks. \\n\\nAs I said previously, Israel spent several decades \"sitting passively\"\\non its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after*\\nthe attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn\\'t work very well.\\nThe \"host\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks \\nfrom its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks\\nwere considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact \\non the civilians caught in their path.  \\n>\\n>|> What?So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states \\n>|> can start all over again?

By your\\ncriteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.\\n\\nThat is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for \\nthe \"interim\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are\\ndemanding conditions that essentially define \"autonomy\" already. They DO\\nNOT trust that Israel will \"follow through\" the entire process and allow\\nPalestinians to reach full autonomy. \\n\\nDo you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians? \\nIf you do, then why should Israel\\'s view of Arabs/Palestinians \\nbe any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians\\' words?\\nSince they don\\'t, they are VERY reluctant to give up \"tangible assets \\n(land, control of areas) in exchange for \"words\". For this reason,\\nthey are also concerned about the sorts of \"guarantees\" they will have \\nthat the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.\\n>\\n>But don\\'t you see that the same statement can be made both ways?\\n>If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word\\n>of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the\\n>Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  \\n\\nAbsolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the\\nIsraelis \"word\" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being\\ndemanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party\\nfinally gets HOLD of this \"land\", what the \"other party\" does\\nis totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land,\\nyour words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to\\nkeeps its word does NOT get the land back.\\n\\n>Afterall, Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from \\n>areas it occupied in Lebanon during SLG.\\n>\\n> Tim, you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been\\n> disarmed.

Hezbollah does\\n> not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up\\n> Sheikh Mosavi, his wife, and young son. \\n\\nWhile the \"major armaments\" (those allowing people to wage \"civil wars\")\\nhave been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still\\nremain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and \"commando\"\\nraids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard\\nfor human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.\\n\\n> Of course, if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon\\n> and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn\\'t\\n> make the Lebanese so mad as to do that.\\n\\nBat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks\\nwere commonplace.\\n\\n>Furthermore, with Hezbollah subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.\\n\\nThere is NO WAY these groups can be effectively \"disarmed\" UNLESS the state\\nis as authoritarian is Syria\\'s. The only other way is for Lebanon to take\\nit upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially\\nmirroring Israel\\'s border secirity on its side.

The Arabs/\\nPalestinians are looking for \"land\" and demanding that they receive it\\nprior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it\\ngives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic\\nsituation (and that change doesn\\'t help Israel\\'s position), and 2) WHEN\\nit gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to\\ncompensate for the increased risks\\n\\nTim\\n\\n\\n',\n",

On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs\\' bus and\\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John\\'s Memorial Stadium.\\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\\nwill return to St John\\'s once the strike ends.\\n===================================================\\nSENATORS SOLD\\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \\nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \\nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \\n\\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\\n==================================================\\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \\n\\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\\n\\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\\nin the New Brunswick city.\\n\\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\\n1400 for this year.\\n============================================================\\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\\n=========================================================\\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps\\' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\\n======================================================\\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\\nhas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and\\nshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic\\nSports Network in Canada (but I\\'m not sure about that). I am not\\nsure if playoff games will be covered.\\n=====================================================\\nUTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?\\nThere were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next\\nseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern\\ncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.\\n=====================================================\\nWHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR\\n\\nONE OPTION\\t\\t\\t\\tANOTHER OPTION\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nNorthern Division\\t\\t\\tSouthern Division\\nADIRONDACK RED WINGS\\t\\t\\tADIRONDACK\\nSPRINGFIELD INDIANS\\t\\t\\tSPRINGFIELD\\nPROVIDENCE BRUINS\\t\\t\\tPROVIDENCE\\nCD ISLANDERS\\t\\t\\t\\tCDI\\nPORTLAND PIRATES\\t\\t\\tHERSHEY\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBINGHAMTON\\nSouthern Division\\t\\t\\tROCHESTER\\nHERSHEY BEARS\\t\\t\\t\\tHAMILTON\\nBINGHAMTON RANGERS\\t\\t\\tUTICA\\nROCHESTER AMERICANS\\nHAMILTON CANUCKS\\t\\t\\tAtlantic Division\\nUTICA (?)

As usual, Sahl\\'s was \\nindependent and sharp as a scalpel.\\n\\tMy effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort\\'s. At \\nleast it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I\\'d mention the \\nidea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for \\ndelivery.\\n\\tThose reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the \\nmost peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are \\nnoted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with \\npassion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in \\nfact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost \\nidentical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German \\nelection). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and \\nenthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their \\nideological quilt.\\n\\tThe last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening \\npages of both books. Hitler\\'s example is when, on page 5, he claims the \\nGerman nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway \\nline between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) \\nwas \"betrayed to France by a representative of his government\" when \\nthere has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.\\n\\tIn fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as \\nthe Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost \\nsucceeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic \\nclaim in his introduction that \"in a school or during a commencement \\nceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional.\" Of \\ncourse, it\\'s not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of \\nGod against an individual\\'s will that\\'s unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is \\ntoo gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.\\n\\tOf course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, \\nmy main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern \\nAmerican Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version \\nof Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925), \\nand trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen \\nmillion followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book \\nafter building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in \\nWeimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.\\n\\tThus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh\\'s daily \\nthree-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary \\npropoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way \\nThings Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a \\ntranslation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the \\nprinted word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since \\nradio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of \\nluxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to \\nspend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop \\n$22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.\\n\\tBut, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some \\ncloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of \\ntheir propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these \\ndays.)\\n\\tMort might not know exactly who Rush\\'s equivalent of Rodolf \\nHess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of \\nABC radio and now Limbaugh\\'s partner in EFM Media, the radio \\nprogram\\'s production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk \\nshow, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He \\nknows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows \\nthat Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the \\nopportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh \\nearns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it\\'s almost worthy of a \\nRICO indictment.\\n\\tOn questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of \\nmaterial in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler\\'s venom. For \\nexample:\\n\\nOn Their Own Qualifications to Control Society\\n\\tHitler: \"Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who \\nindividually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly \\nperhaps understand it, one man [author\\'s emphasis] must step forward in \\norder to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of \\nimagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight \\nfor their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of \\nthought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\" \\n(page 577).\\n\\tLimbaugh: \"Who needs the media when they\\'ve got me? ... The \\nshow is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase \"with half my \\nbrain tied behind my back to make it even\"] denotes the egress of mental \\naptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree \\nwith me ... It might take four or five years, but I\\'m convinced The Media \\nwill slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking \\nand screaming all the way.\" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)\\n\\nOn Religion as the Basis of a Nation\\n\\tHitler: \"In this world human culture and civilization are \\ninseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his \\ndecline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without \\nculture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord \\nsins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the \\nexpulsion from Paradise.\" (Page 581.)\\n\\tLimbaugh: \"America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... \\nBut our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or \\nambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a \\ncharming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools \\nfor the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of \\nAmerican education has declined ever since?\" (pages 274-5.)\\n\\nOn Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse\\n\\tHitler: \"The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... \\nOne has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and \\ntheatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... \\nTheatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays \\nmust be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the \\nservice of a moral idea of State and culture.\" (pages 346 and 348.)\\n\\tLimbaugh: \"Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that \\nHollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people \\nwho believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality \\nand monagamy. They disparage American heroes.\" (page 254.)\\n\\nOn the News Meida\\n\\tHitler: \"The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of \\ngravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass \\nby in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it\\'s task is only to break the \\npeople\\'s folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of \\nslavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews.\" (Page 331.)\\n\\tLimbaugh: \"Elements of The Media have jumped on the \\nbandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been \\nreplaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During \\nthe Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global \\nnetwork. We can\\'t take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don\\'t \\nrealize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that \\ntherefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided \\nand, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania.\" (pages 270 and 268.)\\n\\n*     *     *\\n\\t\\nTo continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but \\nultimately too depressing to take in one reading.\\n\\tAfter putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that \\nhaunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened \\nGermans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed \\nGermans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s, \\nRush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to \\ndepressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American \\nradical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the \\nReagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for \\nThe Fascist States of America.\\n\\tAnd if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the \\nradical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only \\nwonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.\\n\\nThe Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701-\\n0845; (608) 255-4460.\\n\\n--- 30 ---\\n\\n\\n',\n",

This is a pretty broad \\n interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism, \\n roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,\\n motosports enthusiasts.\\n\\n The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little\\n over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from\\n New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada\\n Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.\\n\\n The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need \\n to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of \\n performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise \\n ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.\\n\\n Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to \\n issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \"flame-free\".  \\n\\n HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION\\n ---------------------------------\\n\\n You are welcome to subscribe.

I will not touch another chrysler\\nproduct again, no way.  I don\\'t care how good the LH cars look good, and I\\nwill admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.

Whereas Motor Trend\\nalways thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.\\n\\nAnd although there are alot of people who don\\'t like Consumers Reports, I\\nwill use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink\\nwith the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the\\nshadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the\\nchrysler\\'s rate a better than average, I think the best one is just\\naverage.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH\\'s.  You\\ncan find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched\\nthe Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal\\nof information about this company, just because it is a new american\\ncompany and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for\\ngood reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of\\nany established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I\\nthink this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in\\nToyota said and I quote, \"We are watching them very closely.\"  Come on,\\neverybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been\\nkicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make\\na good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to\\nset in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They\\nare still struggling because they haven\\'t learned yet.

Is\\nit because too many people take French and German in college to make\\nthe accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance.\\nSince the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when\\nthe fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors\\nwere just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength\\nrather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized\\nmedicine approaches like Britain\\'s National Health Service.\\n\\n>\"`You\\'ve got to remember, you\\'ve got a waiting list as well, but it\\'s  \\n>not as obvious.

I have MD friends who can\\'t\\nmake a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance\\nrates but because they won\\'t get enough customers -- the CMA medical\\nmonopoly\\'s grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they\\nmust move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking\\nof waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the\\nU.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis\\nE. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.\\n\\nDoug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada\\'s\\nhealth insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one\\nsmall error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.\\n\\n>WOULDN\\'T NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW  \\n>FULLY INSURED MIGHT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LESS?  \\n>\\n>In Canada, provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental  \\n>care, eyeglasses, prescription drugs, ambulance service, and private  \\n>hospital rooms, -- so many Canadians do end up buying some private  \\n>insurance. A policy to cover all of these things runs about #40 to $40  \\n>a month.  \\n\\nOf course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany\\ncase, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public\\nsector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra\\ninsurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward\\naccomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal\\nbenefits, they\\'ll have nothing to do with you if you want to be\\ncovered for basic care.\\n\\nAt that point, they wouldn\\'t even consider a \"voucher\" approach\\nto broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up\\nthe difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.\\n\\n>******************************************************************  \\n>\\n>WOULDN\\'T FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY  \\n>ACHE AND PAIN?  \\n>\\n>People who get free treatment *do* go to the doctor and hospital about  \\n>a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical  \\n>bills.  \\n>\\n>Still, Canadians -- who pay nothing at the doctor\\'s -- have a lower  \\n>per-person health bill than we do.\\n\\nIt is \"free\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two\\nthings which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like\\nreal health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when\\nworking in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying\\nfor health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my\\npay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only\\nannually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal\\nnaifs will proclaim that it\\'s free, along with the Canadian Left for\\nthat is part of their brainwashing agenda.\\n\\nThe French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine\\'s Summer \\n1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance\\ncoverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For \\n1-30 days, you\\'re covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%\\nafterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private\\nhospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital\\nrate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same\\ncash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid\\nout-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.\\nOver 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,\\nthe other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not\\ngleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and\\nprivate expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that\\nyield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.\\n\\n>ISN\\'T THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY JUST TOO BIG  \\n>AND POWERFUL TO KILL?  \\n>\\n>Dismantling the health segment of our insurance industry would be  \\n>\"politically thorny,\" in the quiet words of one advocate for a  \\n>national plan. Some 1,200 firms now sell more than $192 billion in  \\n>health insurance. They\\'d put up a hard fight. Not only has the industry  \\n>grown eightfold since Canada shut down its own health insurers, but \\n>our government leaves politicians more open to lobbyists than does  \\n>Canada\\'s parliamentary system.\\n\\nHealth insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its\\njust that it doesn\\'t cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada\\nand Germany, but you\\'ll have to go uninsured as a result because\\nthere are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.\\n\\nWhen private insurance realized how much money they\\'d make without the\\nrisks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe\\namenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on\\nthe fritz in someone\\'s private hospital room), they started to pat\\nthemselves on the back for their social responsibility.

Second, the historical\\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even \\nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius\\'s\\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\\nif you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\\na la Chalcedon.\\n\\nSecond, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than\\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\\nthat Jesus\\'s human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\\nprevailed.\\n\\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\\n\\nJason Albert\\n\\n[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The\\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn\\'t see how we could call\\nJesus fully human, because he didn\\'t sin.  I completely agree that\\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\\n\\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there\\'s reason to think\\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\\ngot the better of them.\\n\\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"\\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also\\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to some\\ndegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\\nmust be understood that there\\'s a certain indirectness in the Logos\\'\\nparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort of\\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don\\'t have an\\nincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white\\nterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this\\narea.\\n\\nYou say \"I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus\\'s\\nhuman nature was in heaven.\"  I don\\'t think that\\'s required by\\northodox doctrine.

Can anybody deny these facts?\\n\\nJews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was \\nquite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi \\nrevisionists say!\\n\\n[SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in\\n[SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups)\\n[SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother.\\n[SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were \\n[SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy \\n[SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not \\n[SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n[SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my\\n[SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these \\n[SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe \\n[SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people,\\n[SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...\\n\\nThere is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the\\nArmenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno-\\nGeorgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever \\nkilled in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of\\nAnatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian-\\nGeorgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after\\nthe Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the\\nextermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died\\nin this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of\\npreparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish \\ngenocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers\\naway!\\n\\n[SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people\\n[SY] around, people assumed that \\'Armenians killed us, raped our women\\',\\n[SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed\\n[SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these \\n[SY] people not to hate all Armenians. \\n\\nI don\\'t follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.\\n\\n[SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region,\\n[SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation.\\n[SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some\\n[SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts.\\n[SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish\\n[SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with\\n[SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately\\n[SY] very easy to start a fire!\\n\\nAgain, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to\\ndo with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that\\nthe Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, \\nand Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through \\nTiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians \\nmilitarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of\\nCaucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement \\ncaused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years \\nearlier in eastern Anatolia. My father\\'s mother\\'s family escaped Cemiskezek -> \\nErzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople -> \\nMassachusetts. \\n\\n[SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience\\n[SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were\\n[SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to\\n[SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves\\n[SY] unattractive! I don\\'t want to go into any graphic detail.\\n\\nMy grandmother\\'s brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste\\npotato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian\\nyoung man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential,\\nlocal Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive \\ntoday.\\n\\n[SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense.\\n[SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.

New York prohibits their use in\\n    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,\\n    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They\\n    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.\\n    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other\\n    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.\\n\\nQ:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?\\n\\nA:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,\\n    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe\\n    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.\\n    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently\\n    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate\\n    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.\\n    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected\\n    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a\\n    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned\\n    on.\\n\\nQ:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?\\n\\nA:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance\\n    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target\\n    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR\\n    system.\\n\\nQ:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be\\n    able to handle it? \\n\\nA:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US\\n    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a\\n    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the\\n    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the\\n    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.\\n    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low\\n    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar\\n    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,\\n    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such\\n    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use\\n    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:\\n    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they\\n    are used (or else, don't speed.)\\n\\nQ:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?\\n\\nA:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.\\n    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.\\n    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the\\n    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the\\n    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.\\n\\nDriving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:\\n\\nQ:  What are understeer and oversteer?\\n\\nA:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a\\n    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)\\n    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to\\n    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they\\n    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',\\n    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)\\n    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that\\n    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into\\n    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle\\n    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance\\n    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing\\n    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle\\n    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or\\n    spinning.\\n\\n    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car\\n    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the\\n    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling\\n    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to\\n    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle\\n    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater\\n    slip angle than the front wheels.\\n\\nQ: What is a rev-matched downshift?\\n\\nA: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear\\n   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally\\n   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop\\n   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle\\n   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to\\n   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.\\n\\nQ: What does heel-and-toe mean?\\n\\nA: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while\\n   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot\\n   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you\\n   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to\\n   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;\\n   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side\\n   on the throttle.\\n\\n   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the\\n   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing\\n   the same thing.\\n\\nQ: What is double-clutch downshifting?\\n\\nA: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of\\n   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for\\n   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the\\n   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with\\n   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch\\n   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission\\n   speed up.\\n\\n   The procedure is as follows:\\n   (0) declutch\\n   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral\\n   (2) engage clutch\\n   (3) match revs\\n   (4) declutch\\n   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear\\n   (6) engage clutch\\n\\n   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.\\n   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the\\n   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or\\n   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.\\n   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at\\n   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good\\n   condition.\\n\\nQ: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and\\n   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?\\n\\nA: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and\\n   2) almost never.\\n\\n   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times\\n   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the\\n   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine\\n   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite\\n   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from\\n   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*\\n   major) part of the equation.\\n\\n   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really\\n   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically\\n   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the\\n   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.\\n   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads\\n   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply\\n   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.\\n\\n   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the\\n   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced\\n   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the\\n   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making\\n   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end\\n   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car\\n   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'\\n   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of\\n   caveats could go on for page after page.\\n\\nQ: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according\\n   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate\\n   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?\\n\\nA: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.\\n\\n   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics\\n   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,\\n   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a\\n   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating\\n   temperature.\\n\\n   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser\\n   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a\\n   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been\\n   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match\\n   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire\\n   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses\\n   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling\\n   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire\\n   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will\\n   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its\\n   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some\\n   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like\\n   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.\\n   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal\\n   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of\\n   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)\\n\\n   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,\\n   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters\\n   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than\\n   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible\\n   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of\\n   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques\\n   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.\\n\\nMisc. Questions:\\n\\nQ:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?\\n\\nA:  Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked\\n    about; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names\\n    as misinformation abounds on the net.

Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,\\n    which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some\\n    financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may\\n    be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this\\n    is only speculation at this time.\\n-- \\nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\\n\",\n",

In other\\n>words technically speaking Christians should use Saturday and not Sunday\\n>as their holy day, if they want to conform to the teachings of Jesus.\\n\\nI think the passage you\\'re looking for is the following.\\n\\nMatthew 5:17    \"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the \\nprophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. \\nMatthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, \\nnot an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. \\nMatthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments \\nand teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he \\nwho does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of \\nheaven. \\nMatthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of \\nthe scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. \\n\\nThere are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the\\nLaw was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but\\nnot on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human\\nbeings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The\\nissue that the Church had to face after Jesus\\' death was what to do\\nabout Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to\\nimpose the Law on them didn\\'t say that the Law was abolished.  It\\nsimply acknowledged that fact that it didn\\'t apply to Gentiles.  This\\nis a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.\\n(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded\\nin Acts 15.)\\n\\nHowever there\\'s more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the\\nrole of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul\\'s apparent\\nrejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus\\' commendation of\\nthe Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a\\npurpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this\\nissue isn\\'t one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his\\ndiscussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and\\nassures us that that\\'s not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees\\nthe Law as primarily being present to convict people of their\\nsinfulness.  But ultimately it\\'s an impossible standard, and one that\\nhas been superceded by Christ.  Paul\\'s comments are not the world\\'s\\nclearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the\\ninteresting thing to notice is that even this radical position does\\nnot entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an\\nuncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.\\nFor its purpose of convicting of sin, it\\'s important that it not be\\nrelaxed.  However for Christians, it\\'s not the end -- ultimately we\\nlive in faith, not Law.\\n\\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\\nbut in fact that\\'s not Jesus\\' approach.  Jesus\\' interpretations\\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\\nPaul\\'s conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\\n\\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\\nresponding to specific situations, he\\'s looking at the aspect of the\\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\\nto give Paul so much trouble.\\n\\nIt\\'s unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but\\nwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the\\nway terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from the\\ncurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to\\nfigure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word for\\nopposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I\\nthink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was\\ninvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values\\nthat go along with the term \"Law\", any more than people who concerned\\nabout the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to family\\nvalues.\\n',\n",

To find out more about\\n  them and how to access them, please see the \"Introduction to the\\n  news.answers newsgroup\" posting in news.answers.\\n\\n  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document\\n  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If\\n  you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by\\n  sending a mail message to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu with the\\n  command \"send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups\" in the message body.\\n\\n-----------------------------\\nWhat about the \"Other X FAQ\"?\\n-----------------------------\\n\\n  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and\\n  well written \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" document.\\n  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates\\n  on performance.\\n\\n  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with\\n  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:\\n\\t\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\".\\n  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).\\n\\n---------------\\nWindow Managers\\n---------------\\n\\n  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different\\n  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a\\n  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this\\n  point, most respondents have agreed upon \"twm\" as the best candidate\\n  for a speedy window manager. \\n\\n  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,\\n  is turning off unnecessary things like \"zooming\" and \"opaque move\".\\n  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the\\n  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping\\n  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\\n\\n  I\\'ve found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:\\n  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is\\n  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)\\n  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the\\n  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.\\n\\n------------\\nThe X Server\\n------------\\n\\nWhich Server?\\n- - - - - - -\\n  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.\\n  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.\\n\\n  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven\\'t noticed much difference between\\n  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to\\n  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute\\n  to less paging.  \\n         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),\\n                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]\\n\\n  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law\\n  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be\\n  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.\\n  You can expect to get \"*very* large speedups in the server\" by not\\n  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results\\n  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial\\n  compilers on the market.\\n\\nLocking the Server into RAM?\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and\\n  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help\\n  performance at all?  I\\'ve had one inquiry on this topic, and a few\\n  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone\\n  who\\'s tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  \\n\\t\\t\\t  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]\\nStarting your Server\\n- - - - - - - - - - -\\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\\n    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep\\n    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my\\n    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...\\n    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.\\n\\n  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  \\n\\n  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of\\n  why this works, which I have summarized here:\\n\\n    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to\\n    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by\\n    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of\\n    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the\\n    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you\\n    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself\\n    sorted out before the clients start up.\\n\\n    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X\\n    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources\\n    being fetched, programs initializing state and \"databases\" and so\\n    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this\\n    initialization is done (\"The process has reached a steady state\"),\\n    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.\\n    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your\\n    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your\\n    workstation\\'s limited resources\\n\\n  This is most definitely a \"Your Mileage May Vary\" situation, as there\\n  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap\\n  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients\\n  you are starting, etc.\\n\\n  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n  I\\'ve experimented with:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n  I\\'ve even tried:\\n\\t(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &\\n  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had\\n    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down\\n    into a \"steady state\" before the sleep expired and all my clients\\n    were launched. ]\\n\\n  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with\\n  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to\\n  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.\\n\\nFonts\\n- - -\\n  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts\\n  your applications use, you\\'ll get speed increases in load-up time.\\n\\n  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one\\n  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or\\n  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.\\n  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded\\n  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer\\n  fonts will be loaded by the server.\\n\\t\\t\\t      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),\\n\\t\\t\\t        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]\\n\\n  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13\\n  in all it\\'s menus and icons etc.  Twm\\'s default font is 8x13.  Since\\n  I don\\'t normally use 8x13, I\\'ve eliminated one font from my server.\\n\\n  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):\\n    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.\\n    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.\\n\\nAbout the Resources File\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves\\n    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\\n\\n  One suggestion:\\n\\n    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum\\n    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your\\n    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true\\n\\n    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific\\n    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your\\n    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:\\n\\n\\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N\\n\\n    [ The \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" FAQ contains\\n    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.\\n    --ed.]\\n\\n    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from\\n    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,\\n    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same\\n    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system\\n    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to\\n    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files\\n    with the same name.\\n\\n    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).\\n\\t\\t    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),\\n\\t\\t         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),\\n\\t\\t             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).\\n\\t     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]\\n\\n  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following\\n  benefits:\\n\\n    - Easier to maintain / more usable.\\n\\n    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER\\n      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally\\n      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.\\n\\n    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort \\n      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.\\n\\n  It also has drawbacks:\\n\\n    - the application that you are interested in has to load an\\n      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn\\'t seem to\\n      make that much of a performance difference, and you might\\n      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an\\n      application\\'s resource database, you just need to re-run the\\n      application without having to \"xrdb\" again.\\n\\n    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When\\n      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and\\n      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.\\n      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!\\n\\n      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped\\n      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource\\n      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why\\n      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*\\n      provide any error message when it encountered the C style\\n      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted\\n      processing the resource file.\\n\\n      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef\\n      COLOR\\'\\' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this\\n      method of resource management.\\n\\n    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For\\n      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their\\n      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.\\n\\n    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files\\n      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client\\n      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the\\n      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find\\n      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)\\n\\n  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)\\n  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my\\n  .Xdefaults file, and to use the \"separate resources files\" method for\\n  clients that I seldom use.\\n\\nDefine Your Display Properly\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In\\n  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to \\n  \"<hostname>:0.0\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you\\n  should set your DISPLAY variable to \"unix:0.0\" or \":0.0\".  By doing this\\n  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same\\n  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.\\n\\t\\t\\t[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]\\n\\n  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further\\n  explanation of how to properly set your display name.\\n\\n  \"I don\\'t think it\\'s stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have\\n  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when\\n  the DISPLAY isn\\'t set specially.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)\\n\\n  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change\\n  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.\\n  I don\\'t want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle\\n  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT\\n  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.

Think also\\n  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there\\n  a smaller clock program than xclock?\\n\\n  Unfortunately, I haven\\'t really noticed that programs advertise how large\\n  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.\\n\\n  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients\\n  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]\\n\\n  I\\'ve received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject\\n  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are\\n  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather\\n  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using\\n  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In\\n  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually\\n  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.\\n\\n  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don\\'t mix toolkits.  That is, try\\n  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif\\n  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you\\'re dragging in\\n  more than one toolkit library.\\n\\n  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client\\n  programs would work best together in that environment.\\n\\n\\t\\t  [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET),\\n      Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ]\\n\\nA Better Clock for X\\n- - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n1) xcuckoo\\n   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)\\n   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu\\n\\n   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.\\n   Saves screen real estate.\\n\\n2) mclock\\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar\\n\\n   Non Xt-based.

For\\n   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling\\n   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap\\n   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.

Examining the what was\\n    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource\\n    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget\\n    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.\\n    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the\\n    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user\\n    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not\\n    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference\\n    on a [slower system].\\n\\n  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots\\n  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor\\n  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server\\n  requests?\\n\\n-------------------------\\nMiscellaneous Suggestions\\n-------------------------\\n\\nPretty Pictures\\n- - - - - - - -\\n  Don\\'t use large bitmaps (GIF\\'s, etc) as root window backgrounds.\\n\\n  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server\\n    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)\\n\\n  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I\\'m\\n    conscious of performance issues, I can\\'t comprehend it when I see\\n    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.\\n\\n    I\\'ll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by\\n    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.\\n\\n  - If you\\'re anything like me, you need all the screen real estate\\n    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.\\n\\n\\t\\t      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) \\n\\t\\t\\tfor reminding me of this one. --ed.]\\n\\nA Quicker Mouse\\n- - - - - - - -\\n  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen\\n  when you move your mouse.

Some that stick out:\\n\\n    - For Motif programs, don\\'t set XmFontList resources for individual\\n      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or\\n      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager\\n      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.\\n\\n    - Better yet, don\\'t use Motif at all.  It\\'s an absolute pig.\\n\\n    - Don\\'t create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.\\n      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)\\n\\n    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE\\n      difference.\\n\\n    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the\\n      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable\\n      one.\\n\\n  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :\\n    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc\\n    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based\\n    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying\\n    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn\\'t find the time yet. I did some\\n    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the\\n    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)\\n\\n  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]\\n\\n  Andre\\' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :\\n\\n  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.\\n\\n    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but\\n    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the\\n    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most\\n    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to\\n    run through it\\'s event-loop again and again.\\n\\n  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.\\n\\n    This \"Gfx Context Switching\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,\\n    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed\\n    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching\\n    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will\\n    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the\\n    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).\\n\\nSay What!?\\n- - - - - - \\n  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:\\n\\n  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :\\n    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs\\n    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your\\n    machine onto the other display.

If they\\n    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your\\n    action.\\n\\n    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2\\n    cpu\\'s halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going\\n    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved\\n    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing\\n    even fewer context switches.\\n\\n----------------------------\\nOther Sources of Information\\n----------------------------\\n\\n  Volume 8 in O\\'Reilly\\'s X Window System Series, ``X Window System\\n  Administrator\\'s Guide\\'\\' is a book all X administrator\\'s should read.\\n\\n  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):\\n    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper \"Improving X\\n    Application Performance\" by Chris D.

After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were\\nintermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining\\n5.41 wouldn\\'t even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and\\nexchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.\\n\\nWell, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.\\nOften, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I\\nthen insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive\\nby making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the\\nIIsi and boot from the HD. I\\'ve called La Cie again and they\\'ve given me\\nanother RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn\\'t see\\nthe drive there\\'s a definite hardware problem.\\n\\nGiven that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send\\nme a *new* one, but they said \"no.\" Also, within three weeks after I purchased\\nmy original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.\\n\\nI can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors\\nmake a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And\\nI understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden\\nprice fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these\\nfacts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that\\nwhen I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one\\nthey will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I\\'ll have to again\\nreinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data\\nrecovery.)\\n\\nIt seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a\\ndiscounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still\\ncovered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. \\n\\nI feel a little helpless about all this. I don\\'t mean to necessarily flame La\\nCie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.\\nBut c\\'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent\\na letter to La Cie\\'s customer service when the first drive was returned and I\\nasked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive\\nthree weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply\\nthe credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn\\'t even \\nhave the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)\\n\\nWhat\\'s the moral of this story? I\\'m not sure.

It \\nprobably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, \\nbut we wouldn\\'t get a good idea of how well or what it feels like \\nbecause, without the contact patches, we can\\'t turn.  Maybe there\\'s a \\nbetter way. Besides, even ice doesn\\'t get rid of the contact patch\\nforces altogether, so we\\'d have to find a really frictionless surface.\\nYou\\'d have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it\\nwas the rotation that did it.\\n\\nLooking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.\\nNow we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and\\ndirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them\\nabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.\\nHow it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we\\'re just looking\\nfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and not\\nsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don\\'t know of any snow-ski\\nor skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged\\nlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.\\nI think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like\\nthat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.\\nNow I admit that this is second hand info (although I\\'d love to try\\none of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in\\na bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very\\nmuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.\\nSo we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike\\'s,\\na similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have\\ncountersteering.\\n\\nConclusion: you don\\'t need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have\\nmotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don\\'t know what\\nreal effect the gyroscopes have when they\\'re there, but from my observations\\nof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I\\'m \\nwilling to bet that they\\'re not the dominant factor in countersteering. \\n\\nIf you don\\'t like this conclusion, then don\\'t accept it, but my motorcycle\\'s\\nbehaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.\\n\\nI\\'ve        bike                      like       | Jody Levine  DoD #275 kV\\n     got a       you can        if you      -PF  | Jody.P.Levine@hydro.on.ca\\n                         ride it                 | Toronto, Ontario, Canada\\n',\n",

None\\nof us is violent or criminal in any way,\" said Carol El-Shaieb, an education\\nconsultant who develops programs on Arab culture.\\n   The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens, son of former Israel Defense Minister\\nMoshe Arens. The younger Arens, a research scientist at the University of\\nSouthern California, said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably\\nbecause he has criticized Israel\\'s treatment of Palestinians.\\n   \"The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speaks\\npolitically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite,\" Arens said.\\n   The ADL has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn\\'t comment on the lawsuit\\nbecause it hasn\\'t reviewed it, said a spokesman at the ADL\\'s New York\\nheadquarters.\\n   The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that\\nthe ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, including\\nwhite supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations, Arab-Americans, Greenpeace,\\nthe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco\\npublic television station KQED.\\n   Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government\\nrecords, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit.\\nNo charges have been filed in the criminal investigation.\\n   The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California\\'s privacy law, which\\nforbids the intentional disclosure of personal information \"not otherwise\\npublic\" from state or federal records.\\n   The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to \"persons and\\nentities\" who had no compelling need to receive it. It didn\\'t elaborate.\\n   Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut, director of the ADL\\'s office in San\\nFrancisco.

They \\ndidn\\'t disown me but they didn\\'t completely accept the situation either.  \\nFor example, they didn\\'t come to my wedding because it was in a church.   \\nWhen I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her \\ndeath, she said to me, \"As far as I\\'m concerned, you still are a Jew.\" \\nWhat she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.

I gave up the past.\\n\\nThis is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their \\nexperience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while \\nfollowing Jesus.

That which is authoratative is authoratative,\\nand to say \"I question to word of this authority\" is ridiculous. If it is \\nopen to question, it isn\\'t an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectly\\nreasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrase\\nhere should be \"authenticate authority.\" Once you have authenticated\\nyour authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it as\\nan authority. \\n\\nThe difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You \\ncan perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency\\nin what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of\\ndiscourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, in\\ninself, accredit it. (Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and \\nother that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.)\\nI cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings, \\nbecause if I can independantly verify its teachings, I don\\'t need an \\nauthority. I need an authority only when there is information I need which\\nI cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I must\\ndo it by some means other than by examining its teachings. \\n\\nIn practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don\\'t\\nhave time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientist\\nworing today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sorts\\nof knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to \\nverify for himself.\\n\\nIn spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source \\nofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. (I am\\na Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seem\\nthe strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter for\\nbelief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).\\n\\nThe atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is a\\nreasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty.\\nIf you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility of\\nevery receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possibly\\nchange. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific. \\n\\nTo demand scintific or rational proof of God\\'s existence, is to deny\\nGod\\'s existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very\\nnature, prove anything.\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\n==============================================================================\\nMark Baker                  | \"The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but \\naa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts.\" -- C.

Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  \\nI BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even \\nafter reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.\\n\\nBut first let me say the following.\\nWe might have a language problem here - in regards to \"faith\" and\\n\"existence\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.\\nTo exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE\\nbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not\\nexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it\\'s rather pointless\\nto debate the so called \"existence\" of God - and that is not what\\nI\\'m doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of\\nbeing. When you say that \"god does not exist\", I also accept this\\nstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,\\nin what follows I will use the phrase \"the existence of God\" in it\\'s\\n\\'usual sense\\' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.\\nI would like a clarification upon what you mean by \"the existence of\\nGod\".\\n \\nWe also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what\\nWebster says:\\n\\nfaith \\n1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY\\nb  (1): fidelity to one\\'s promises\\n   (2): sincerity of intentions\\n2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God\\n   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion\\nb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof\\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n   (2): complete trust\\n3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system \\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nof religious beliefs\\nsyn see BELIEF\\n\\n\\n\\nOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say\\nthat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\\n\"based upon observation\", I will have to ask \"what observtions are\\nyou refering to?\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that\\nare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations\\ncan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even\\nbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes \\npartents \"believe in God\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion\\nabout the \"existence\" or \"non-existence\" of God requires a leap - and\\nyou have made this leap when you actively say \"I believe that God  \\ndoes/does not exist\". Personally, I think that both statements are\\nmisguided.

ALL of them.\\n\\n\\t\\tDon\\'t tell me they do not exist.  They are standard\\n\\t\\tequipment.\\n\\n\\t2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?\\n\\n\\t\\ta)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This\\n\\t\\t  aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable\\n\\t\\t  as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t.... gotcha!\\n\\n\\t\\t  ... when in isolation from other substances.\\n\\n\\t\\t  WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote\\n\\t\\t  launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce \"this window,\\n\\t\\t  blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come\\n\\t\\t  down\", and maintain a left to right sequence?\\n\\n\\t\\tb)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when\\n\\t\\t  mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)\\n\\t\\t  suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to\\n\\t\\t  brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long\\n\\t\\t  exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend\\n\\t\\t  to ignite.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat other chemicals come up in the forensics?\\n\\t\\t\\tWho else will be allowed to test the site?\\n\\n\\t\\tc)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation\\n\\t\\t  rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made\\n\\t\\t  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature\\n\\t\\t  above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain\\n\\t\\t  heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length\\n\\t\\t  of time (start a wall fire and wait).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tCheck your military records; look at the tapes.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhy were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),\\n\\t\\t\\ttear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why\\n\\t\\t\\tthe hurry. was there still a comm channel open\\n\\t\\t\\tto the outside?).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tDo you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the\\n\\t\\t\\tcompound in the videos?  ALL the videos?  Which ones\\n\\t\\t\\tare missing?\\n\\n\\tDo I sound paranoid?  Maybe.  Am I? Probably not.\\n\\tYou trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement?\\n\\t\\tIN advance of a Court?

After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement\\n of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of\\n the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced\\n the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor \\n suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.\\n\\n While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being \\n manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently\\n increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (\\n palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part\\n the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had\\n been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the\\n pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is \\n persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3\\n and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides\\n minor reductions in pain and is only short term.  \\n\\n My questions are: \\n\\n     Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the\\n     levels of pain?\\n\\n     Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?\\n\\n     Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?\\n\\n\\n  Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.\\n  \\n  \\n  Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.\\n\\n  If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup\\n  that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated.\\n   \\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\nGregory W.

Fortunately, his opposition was influential enough\\n#for the feds to back off.\\n#\\n#Do you mean that the \"secular authorities\" are some continuous group of\\n#people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing/eradicating the\\n#Mormons?

In addition, we believe that the adversary\\nhas power to influence the unjust and idolatrous (greed for money would be\\na good example) in order to bring about persecution, war, oppression, and\\nevil combinations.  As an intelligent being, don\\'t you suppose that the\\ndestroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power?\\n\\nAs far as Utah is concerned, what I pointed out were some horrible examples\\nof environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities, which have\\nbrought death, disease, (i.e. the \"downwinders\") and environmental contami-\\nnation.

Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would  \\nlead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.   \\nThree year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis  \\nlast year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  \\nlifetime.  \\n\\nEven though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives  \\nof enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  \\nPapillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide  \\nsupport for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  \\nnewsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid  \\nin the prevention, cure, and treatment.\\n\\nSince medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  \\nthose viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money  \\nwere available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant  \\nattention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP  \\nFoundation's mission is to change that. \\n\\nAnyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call  \\nMarlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the  \\nFoundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown  \\nPrinceton, or sent directly to:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Recurrent Respiratory Foundation\\n\\t                50 Wesleyan Drive\\n\\t                Hamilton Sq., NJ  08690.\\nThanks   mstern@lindsay.princeton.edu\\n\",\n",

The former is used on passports\\n|> etc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I\\n|> am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all\\n|> times and present them at many public places, almost every day.\\n|> These ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab.\\n|> You maintain that this mainly because of religious services\\n|> provided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ?\\n|> Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it\\n|> serves no other purpose ?\\n\\nA number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner\\nin which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens,\\nand tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For\\ncitizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves\\non a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places,\\nis for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place\\nin banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc...\\nQuite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card\\nfor such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or\\nrequirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public.\\nFurthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against\\nthe bearer in any manner by having access to this information.\\n\\nThe only case that I can think of in which the Le\\'um field might\\nbe taken into account is during interaction with the police,\\nbased upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are\\nclearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore\\nbecomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field\\nis being used to discriminate against them officially.\\n\\n\\n|> In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that\\n|> Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel\\'s borders were\\n|> \\'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace\\'. According to what I\\n|> read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had\\n|> plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into\\n|> Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of\\n|> Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel\\'s borders, when Israel was\\n|> established, as this might restrict Israel\\'s opportunities for\\n|> later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the\\n|> fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the\\n|> land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God\\n|> promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the\\n|> borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use\\n|> today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can\\'t it declare what\\n|> it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a\\n|> base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one\\n|> cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a\\n|> number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).\\n\\nI take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries\\ndo know that they have nothing to fear from \"Israeli expansionism\".\\nMilitarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of\\nland under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a\\nsustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing\\nthe Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli\\nwithdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the\\nAwali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal\\nstrip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire.\\nPublic opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada\\nvia territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from\\nbattle fatigue of sorts and the gov\\'t is aware of it.\\n\\nWith regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree\\nwith the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux\\nof the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating\\na starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal\\nand a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders,\\nthe negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state\\nsmaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller\\nborders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be\\nsettled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic\\nand sensible.\\n\\n|> Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public\\n|> official. I don\\'t think your answer is honest.  You refer me to\\n|> Vanunu\\'s revelations about Israel\\'s nuclear arsenal without\\n|> evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said\\n|> the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why\\n|> should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.\\n\\nYour statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a \"center for\\npolicy research\".  Whether or not all of Vanunu\\'s revelations were true has no\\nbearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing \"state secrets\"\\nafter having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that\\nsaid secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished.\\nAs to which were and which weren\\'t, I am under no moral obligation\\nto disclose that - quite the reverse in fact.\\nHe was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issue\\nwith a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the\\nconcept of \"Secrets of state\", something which every democratic govt\\nhas.\\n\\n|> Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning\\n|> \\'hidden prisoners\\' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from\\n|> Ma\\'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do\\n|> exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?\\n\\nI noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist\\nmore than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted,\\nwhich you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such\\nreports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill,\\nas tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not\\nmade public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know\\nabout it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be\\nmade public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours.\\nThis would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an\\nannouncement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.\\n\\n|> You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a\\n|> way to \\'cast aspersions upon Israel\\'. Such terms have often been\\n|> used by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet\\n|> Union into disrepute.

This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.\\n\\nWell, I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Such\\nquestions are often termed \"tabloid journalism\" and are not\\ndisturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity.\\nSuch questions were often used during the McCarthy era as\\na basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.  To use\\nyour own example, these questions might have been lifted\\nfrom the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking\\nfor small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray\\nas a larger and dirtier picture.\\n\\nMy answers were not any more \"hysterical\" than the questions\\nthemselves.  The problem is not that the q\\'s were provocative,\\nit was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  You\\nfall into the same category of those who seek \"yes\" \"no\" answers\\nwhen the real answer is \"of sorts\".\\nI suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an\\nunequivocal NO, you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete\\nthem as you see fit.  A sign of strength is the ability to look\\nYou remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated\\nculling wolves because of the cruelty to deer, only to find that they\\nhad broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment\\nthey sought to protect.

After he and his brother Hyram\\n#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over\\n#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like\\n#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider\\n#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I\\'m led to understand.  Make\\n#no mistake, this was no messiah we\\'re talking about in Smith).  The\\n\\nAnd neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral\\naptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have\\nnothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \"crime\"\\nwas that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried\\nto explain the \"Smith phenomenon\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5\\nmillion member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith\\'s\\ntestimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.\\n\\n#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed\\n#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only\\n#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have\\n#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The\\n#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn\\'t of much help\\n#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.\\n#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited\\n#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other\\n#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)\\n\\n\"The rest\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,\\nwhile the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various\\nauxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new\\nprophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and\\ndoctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in\\nline to fill the prophet Joseph Smith\\'s vacancy: he was the senior\\napostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated\\nthat it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.\\n\\nOther rightful \"heirs\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated\\n(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,\\nJoseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty\\nland beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This\\n\"Rekhabite\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated\\nby the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.\\n\\nGranted, a couple of \"do-it-yourselfers\" stayed behind, unwilling to\\nsacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but\\nthis also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The\\nchurch benefitted from this purification process: they became even\\nmore unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.\\n\\n#        Both sects practiced the \"1-year food stockpile\" doctrine,\\n#and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at\\n#least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a\\n#militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than\\n#face large-scale opposition.

       " u'From: JEK@cu.nih.gov\\nSubject: God, morality, and massacres\\nLines: 258\\n\\nA listmember (D Andrew Killie, I think) wrote, in response to the\\nsuggestion that genocide may sometimes be the will of God:\\n\\n > Any God who works that way is indescribably evil,\\n > and unworthy of my worship or faith.\\n\\nNobuya \"Higgy\" Higashiyama replied (as, in substance, did others):\\n\\n > Where is your source of moral standards by which you judge God\\'s\\n > behavior?\\n\\nIt is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge God\\'s\\nactions.  Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a\\ncontrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of\\nSodom (Genesis 18), Abraham says:\\n\\n + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.\\n + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?\\n + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!\\n + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\\n\\nI am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and\\ncan perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as\\n\\n + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!\\n\\nThere are those who say that the definition of \"good\" is \"whatever\\nGod happens to want.\" But if that is so, then the statement that God\\nis good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants.\\nThat being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He\\nis good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is\\npowerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he\\ntells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you\\ndefy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes\\nsense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you\\ndon\\'t. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to\\nGenesis 18 and to Christianity in general.\\n\\nAny theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any\\nfurther discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God)\\nmeaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements\\nare always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements\\nin particular cases about the course of action most likely to\\nachieve a good result.\\n\\nWhen I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in\\nhistory, those actions often seem to me very different from what I\\nmight expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us.\\nMoreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural\\nworld, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might\\nexpect if it were the work of a benevolent deity.  (Origen said:\\n\"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of\\nthe Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort\\nof difficulties that they find in Nature.\")\\n\\nNow, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an\\nargument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God.\\nOn the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose\\nthat I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every\\ntime he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: \"Good move!\\nJust what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if\\nI were playing.\" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a\\nchess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at\\nleast some of his moves will have me thinking, \"Now, what do suppose\\ninduced him to do that?\" or even, \"Boy, that was a real slip -- he\\'s\\njust thrown the game away!\" Similarly, if God understands the\\nworkings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that\\nsometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.\\n\\nOne difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the\\ncontrols of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess\\ngame. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was\\ncarelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier.\\nHowever, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a\\ntime when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did\\nnot take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had\\nthought.\\n\\nWith God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total\\nresult of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging\\nthat I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier\\nthan my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.\\n\\n     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****\\n\\nIn the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph\\'s ten older brothers,\\nwho (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell\\nhim into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and\\nwhen there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his\\nfamily. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: \"Do\\nnot worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.\"\\n\\nI once heard a rabbi speak on this text. He said:\\n\\n        The history of the Jews is largely a history of events\\n   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued\\n   survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,\\n   amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews\\n   and of Judaism.\\n        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup\\n   of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of\\n   the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out\\n   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if\\n   they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have\\n   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into\\n   their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few\\n   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a\\n   disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into\\n   the Promised Land.\\n        Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered\\n   sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,\\n   destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of\\n   the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would\\n   be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.\\n   Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of\\n   assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the\\n   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility\\n   cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human\\n   sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never\\n   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.\\n   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the\\n   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.\\n        Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming\\n   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only\\n   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem\\n   every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,\\n   with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place\\n   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the\\n   Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in\\n   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,\\n   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the\\n   controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish\\n   people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge\\n   of all humans everywhere.\\n        Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by\\n   that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather\\n   the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined\\n   to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and\\n   the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might\\n   think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.\\n   The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah\\n   portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage\\n   from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss\\n   that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of\\n   Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)\\n   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it\\n   had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would\\n   probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism\\n   saved them.\\n\\n        [Other examples here omitted for brevity\\'s sake.]\\n\\n        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became\\n   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR\\n   LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,\\n   everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on\\n   stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the\\n   studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast\\n   Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she\\n   later realized that if she had played the screen role, she\\n   would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.\\n   It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney\\n   offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for\\n   it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking\\n   at Walt Disney, she said, \"And now, my special thanks to the\\n   man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\" It was the most\\n   memorable line of the evening.\\n        In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in\\n   the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive\\n   to this day, beginning with Joseph\\'s brothers, and continuing\\n   with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus\\n   Epiphanes....\\n\\nAfter the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him\\nprivately and said, \"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren\\'t\\nyou?\" He answered, \"If that is an example that came to your mind,\\nthen you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not\\ntalk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\" I assume\\nthat he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no\\nstate of Israel.\\n\\nSomeone hearing the rabbi\\'s lecture might leap to the conclusion\\nthat God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His\\npurposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go\\non to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God\\'s doing -- that He\\nstirred up Joseph\\'s brothers to a murderous hate against him, and\\nthat when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh\\'s\\nheart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.\\nAnd this raises questions about how an action can be considered\\nwicked and at the same time be considered something that God has\\nbrought about.\\n\\nI suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has\\na log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,\\ninstead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot\\nthat spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers\\nthe wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the\\nknot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color\\nof the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that\\nobservers will say: \"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a\\npiece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its\\npresence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a\\ngreat work of art.\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was\\nlooking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not\\ncontained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,\\nbut a different one. So, if Joseph\\'s brothers had not sold him, God\\nwould still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,\\nbut He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not\\nbetrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected\\nJesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if\\nPilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set\\nJesus free, it might appear that there would have been no\\nCrucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no\\nSalvation. Not so. God did not need Judas\\' sin to redeem us. If\\nJudas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled\\nthe world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know\\nhow Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its\\ninterior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and\\njust as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth\\ngame agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops\\nand had attacked Fisher\\'s knight instead (don\\'t bother to look up\\nthe game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is\\nnone the less valid).\\n\\nThus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of\\nPilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice\\nwas not God\\'s doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God\\'s\\nplans by behaving justly and courageously.\\n\\nWhat, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \"I\\nwill harden Pharaoh\\'s heart, so that he will not let the people go\"?\\nSome Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet\\nwith God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty\\nwere not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather\\nthat what God was telling Moses was something like this: \"If you see\\nthat Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be\\ndiscouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My\\npurposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and\\nlet the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his\\nresistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future\\nhistorians and theologians will suppose that I would have been\\nthrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\"\\n\\nTo return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible\\nthat the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are\\ninstruments of God\\'s will?\\n     First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what\\nJoseph\\'s brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.\\nThey intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that\\ndoes not make them any less subject to just condemnation and\\npunishment.\\n     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not\\nthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had\\nrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the\\ngood He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.\\n\\n Yours,\\n James Kiefer\\n',\n",

I believe all of the\\npeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I\\nfeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to\\ngo but that they would deserve it more. \\n\\nIMHO \\nDave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he\\ncould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not\\nthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the\\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society.

Are the stats good enough? I am not\\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's).

I\\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame.

I think I heard something about him\\nhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not\\nhear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the\\ncontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model.

Well, I now have the\\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\\n\\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to\\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\\npolygons). For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outlines:\\n\\n\\t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\\n\\t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\\n\\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \\nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\\ntwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \"polygon with\\nholes\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\\n\\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\\n\\n\\t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple\\n\\t\\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\\n\\t\\tsome fancy fonts).\\n\\t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.\\n\\nFrom my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid\\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as\\nis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal\\npolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.\\n\\nMy question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into\\npolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution\\nsince it creates excess number of polygons.\\n\\nAnother question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create\\nbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these\\nsubjects but I can\\'t tell which method is the best to implement.\\n\\nThanks for any pointers.\\n\\n--> Rob Lansdale\\n\\n-- \\nRobert Lansdale - (416) 978-6619       Dynamic Graphics Project\\t\\nInternet: lansd@dgp.toronto.edu        Computer Systems Research Institute\\nUUCP:   ..!uunet!dgp.toronto.edu!lansd University of Toronto\\nBitnet:\\t  lansd@dgp.utoronto           Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A4, CANADA\\n',\n",

We\\'ll be riding some twisty, \\n   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).\\n\\nCommunication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler\\nback every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled\\nMagna, we can hear each other.  It\\'s only above, say, 45 MPH that you \\ncan\\'t really communicate.\\n\\nBalance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how\\nthey\\'re going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately\\nand lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning\\nthing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a\\npain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay\\nperpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn\\nand WHIP AROUND until they\\'re in the `correct\\' position.  This always\\nscrews up the line I\\'ve picked out.\\n\\nHere\\'s my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:\\n\\t- attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.\\n\\t- Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not\\n\\t  get on/off unless I say you can.  (I\\'ve had people try to dismount\\n\\t  in traffic, just as I\\'m pulling in to a parking space!)\\n\\t- Muffler gets HOT! (\\'Nuff said)\\n\\t- We get *GOOD* traction.  We\\'re not going to fall over.  (Many\\n\\t  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)\\n\\t- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you\\'re sitting upright and\\n\\t  we\\'re going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you\\'re\\n\\t  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel\\n\\t  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  \\n\\t- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be \\n\\t  gradual, so I can compensate.\\n\\t- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.\\n\\t- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right \\n\\t  thing -- I\\'ve driven many miles on this thing, and know how\\n\\t  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to\\n\\t  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to \\n\\t  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, \\n\\t  and whever we topped 35 mph, she\\'d holler, \"SLOW DOWN! I\\'M SCARED\" \\n\\t  I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with \\n\\t  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.\\n\\t  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the\\n\\t  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her\\n\\t  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to \\n\\t  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)\\n\\nUsually I\\'ll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, \\ntires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.\\nHelps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.\\n\\nWatch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little\\nmudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will\\nbe nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.\\nIt doesn\\'t help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the \\nfirst trip!\\n\\nGood luck -- have fun!\\n--\\nDON\\'T DRINK SOAP!

Your theory is that it is\\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\\n\\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\\nIslam => lack of education and power.\\n\\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\\nother reasons for this situation.\\n\\n>You blame Muslims for not following the Quran, but I blame Muslims \\n>for following the Quran. \\n\\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\\nfollowing the Qur\\'an or not.\\n\\n>Your idea is baseless from historical\\n>facts, it is a poor utopia, \\n\\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \"following the Qur\\'an\"\\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\\nfact which contradicts your theory. \\n\\n>while my ideas are derived from social\\n>and economic history. \\n\\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\\nthis.\\n\\n>My solution to all Muslims is simple:\\n>CUT THE CRAP, \\n\\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\\n\\n>GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT \\n\\nHere too.\\n\\n>AND WORK HARD TO REVERSE\\n>THE EFFECTS OF 1300 YEARS OF IGNORANCE.\\n\\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\\n\\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\\nyou are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start\\nthinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our\\npostings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously\\nhave.\\n\\n Fred Rice\\n darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   \\n',\n",

(Yup, there are\\nplaces where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near the\\nbottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 million\\nor so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing\\npriorities.\\n\\nIf the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects\\nthat will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clinton\\nadministration has been publicizing the issue.\\n\\nA final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It is\\nworth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans\\' opposition to them\\nis new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally \\nsupported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending,\\narguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending\\npriorities than \"Washington bureaucrats.\"  \\n\\nIs it clear now?

Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\\n\\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\\n\\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\\n\\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\\n\\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\\n\\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\\n\\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\\n\\tin second stage.\"\\n\\n    This really is a good answer, but it\\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\\'ll try\\n    to interpret.\\n\\n    1)\\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\\n\\n    2)\\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\\n\\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\\n\\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\\n\\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\\n\\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\\tThis causes a little bit of\\n\\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\\n\\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\\n\\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\\'re about the\\n\\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\\n\\n    3)\\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\\n\\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\\n\\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\\n\\tthe case if we didn\\'t roll (\"performance gain\").\\n\\n    4)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\\n\\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\\n\\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\\n\\tcomplexity\").\\n\\n    5)\\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\\n\\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\\n\\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\\n\\n    6)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\\n\\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\\n\\n    7)\\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\\n\\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\\n\\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\\n\\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\\n\\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\\n\\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\\n\\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\\n\\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn\\'t the launch pad oriented to give\\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\\'s.  (A side note: the\\n    Saturn V\\'s also had a roll program.  Don\\'t ask me why -- I\\'m a Shuttle\\n    guy.)\\n\\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\\tHe added that the \"roll\\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\\n    array.\\n\\n\\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\\n\\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\\n    for these viewers.\\n\\n    If you can\\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\\n    It\\'s worth asking if yours doesn\\'t.\\n\\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\\n    are not being covered.\\n\\n\\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\\n\\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\\n\\n\\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\\n\\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\\n\\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\\n\\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\\n\\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\\n\\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\\n\\n\\tStation    VHF\\t   10m\\t   15m\\t   20m\\t  40m\\t 80m\\n\\t------\\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\\t-----\\n\\tW6FXN\\t 145.46\\n\\tK6MF\\t 145.585\\t\\t\\t 7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tWA3NAN\\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\\t3.860\\n\\tW5RRR\\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\\t3.850\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.340  14.270\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tW1AW\\t\\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\\t3.990\\n\\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\\n\\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot\\nfaster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is\\nnot unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective\\nclothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong,\\nyou are likely to be less severely injured.\\n\\nFirst thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course,\\nthis will get you started on the right foot -- they teach\\ncontrol of the vehicle and safe riding practices.\\n\\nSecond, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet\\nand a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy \\npiece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking\\nboots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine\\nfor this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay \\ntied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps\\nare nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the\\npants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable,\\npreferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for\\na jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though\\nmore people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another\\nthing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand\\nleather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.\\n\\nThird don\\'t do anything stupid -- don\\'t ride after \\ndrinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement\\nand balance; don\\'t ride in the snow, or when conditions\\nare such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding\\nin the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly, \\nbrake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick,\\ntired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or\\notherwise not in average shape.\\n\\nWith care, you should be ok.\\n\\n>The next question I have is what bike would you recommend for\\n>a first time rider.

If\\nyou are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as\\nlow as a 300-400 cc bike.\\n\\nPossible models: \\nThe Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally\\ninline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to \\nweakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier \\nproblems.)  My first bike was a (about \\'82) GS650, it server me well.\\n\\nThe Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series\\nI think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of\\nstandard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.\\n\\nKawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don\\'t know\\nthem as well.\\n\\nFor mid to late \\'80s models of the above, you should be able to\\nbuy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective \\nclothing and insurance and licensing costs.\\n\\nHope this helps,\\n-David\\n(dagibbs@qnx.com)\\n',\n",

I was referring to the fact\\nthat far more aeronautical development took place in the \\'30\\'s.  For much\\nof the \\'20\\'s, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the\\nindustry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired\\nand Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point\\nwhere long-distance flights became practical.  It\\'s important to note that\\nthe Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh,\\nChamberlin and Levine, and Byrd\\'s _America_.  \"When it\\'s time to railroad,\\nyou railroad.\"\\n\\n>>It didn\\'t require gov\\'t to fund these as long as something was known about\\n>>the potential for profit at the destination.

The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft),\\nOrteig\\'s prize, Lord Northcliffe\\'s prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in\\n1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.

Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals.\\nBrian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good\\ngoaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the\\nstretch to preserve the Blues lead.\\n\\nThe Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and\\ntaking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty\\non Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the\\nblue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired\\na long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After\\nthe goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks\\n10-9 in the first period.\\n\\nJeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on\\nthe left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour\\ncame out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown\\ncollected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.\\n\\nTwo minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a\\nshort-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy\\nRoenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass\\nacross the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.\\n\\nNoonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1.\\nStephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat\\nStephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan\\ndeflected the puck in the net.\\n\\nDenny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the\\nrebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for\\nthe shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards\\nto Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues\\noutshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.\\n\\nWith the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked\\nup a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith\\nwas called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.\\n\\nThe Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into\\nthe two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot,\\nand Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and\\npassed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp\\nangle.\\n\\nJust 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson\\nEmerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with\\ntwo Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the\\nslot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.\\n\\nThe Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph\\nmade some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy\\nMurray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game.\\nThe Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the\\npuck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held\\non to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period,\\ntotaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent\\nin the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on\\non four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in\\nthe league.

Anybody know?\\n\\nI don\\'t know, but I\\'m as willing to speculate as anyone.\\n\\nSeveral people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography.\\nAnother possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other\\nalgorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on\\na session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something\\nlike DES) for the encryption.\\n\\nHow could the \"back door\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few\\npossibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that\\nthe session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door\\nkeys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers\\nused in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.\\n\\nAnother possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips\\nsimply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip\\'s own\\ninternal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys\\nusable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip\\'s\\nsecret key doesn\\'t need to be a public key in this usage, but can be\\nidentical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most\\nstraightforward to me.)\\n\\nStill another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the\\nmessage itself has a \"dual key\" property, that possession of either of\\ntwo keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from\\nthe DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised\\nduring her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and\\nDecember was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would\\nparticipate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn\\'t quite fit into\\nwhat we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early\\nknowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with\\nClipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.\\n\\nHal Finney\\n',\n",

He is walking and saying something,\\nand the children behind him are shouting, \"Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" and \\n\"Down with the Armenians!\" They shout it again, and then shout, \"Hurrah!\" The \\npeople streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I \\nsaw that there were women, too. I say, \"My God, there are women there too!\" \\nAnd my son says, \"Those aren\\'t women, Mamma, those are bad women.\" Well we \\ndidn\\'t look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I \\nsimply couldn\\'t sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani \\nneighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, \"Khalida, what\\'s going on, what \\nhappened?\" She says, \"Emma, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know what \\nhappened.\" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks, \\neach second or third one had a white rod. They\\'re waving the rods above their \\nheads as they walk, and the one who\\'s out front, like a leader, he has a white\\nstick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I \\ndon\\'t know.\\n\\nMy husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, \"Oh \\ndear, I\\'m frightened, they\\'re going to kill us I bet.\" And he says, \"What are \\nyou afraid of, they\\'re just children.\" I say, \"Everything that happens comes \\nfrom children.\" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and \\nVocational School. \"Don\\'t fear,\" he said, \"it\\'s nothing, nothing all that \\nbad.\" He didn\\'t eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they\\nbroadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran. \\nWhen I heard that I couldn\\'t settle down at all, I kept walking here and \\nthere and I said, \"They\\'re going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to \\nkill us.\" And he says, \"Don\\'t be afraid.\" Then we heard--from the central \\nsquare, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they\\'re shouting\\ndifferent things, and you couldn\\'t hear every well. I say, \"You speak\\nAzerbaijani well, listen to what they\\'re saying.\" He says \"Close the window\\nand go to bed, there s nothing happening there.\" He listened a bit and then \\nclosed the window and went to bed, and told us, \"Come on, go to sleep, it\\'s\\nnothing.\" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window\\nuntil two in the morning watching. Well he\\'s sick, and all of this was\\naffecting him. I say, \"Igor, you go to bed, I\\'m going to go to bed in a minute\\ntoo.\" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed. \\nThings had calmed down slightly.\\n\\nThe 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, \"Come on, Emma, \\nget up.\" I say, \"Today\\'s my day off, let me rest.\" He says, \"Aren\\'t you going \\nto make me some tea?\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \"Where are \\nyou going?\" He says, \"I\\'m going out, I have to.\" I say, \"Can you really go \\noutside on a day like today? Don\\'t go out, for God\\'s sake. You never listen to\\nme, I know, and you\\'re not going to listen to me now, but at least don\\'t take \\nthe car out of the garage, go without the car.\" And he says, \"Come on, close \\nthe door!\" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn\\'t make it\\nout, he probably said \"coward\" or something.\\n\\nI closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up\\naround the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o\\'clock in the after-\\nnoon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said,\\n\"Khalida, was it our car?\" She says, \"No, no, Emma, don\\'t be afraid, they\\nwere government cars and Zhigulis.\\'\\' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited,\\nit was four o\\'clock, five o\\'clock . . . and when he wasn\\'t home at seven I\\nsaid, \"Oh, they\\'ve killed Shagen!\"\\n\\nTires are burning in town, there\\'s black smoke in town, and I\\'m afraid, I\\'m \\nstanding on the balcony and I\\'m all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God, \\nthey\\'ve probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten \\no\\'clock and he still hadn\\'t come home. And I\\'m afraid to go out. At ten\\no\\'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore,\\nand from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside. \\nI\\'m looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I \\ndon\\'t want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn\\'t want me to see \\nit. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \"Mamma,\" he says,\\n\"look what they\\'re doing over there!\" They were burning everything, and there \\nwere police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing \\non the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are \\nthrowing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony \\nis shouting, \"What are you standing there for, burn it!\" When they threw the \\ntelevision, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out \\non her balcony and shouted, \"Why are you doing that, why are you burning those\\nthings, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their \\nhome. Why are you burning them?\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \"Go \\ninside, go inside! Instead why don\\'t you tell us if they are any of them in \\nyour building or not?\" They meant Armenians, but they didn\\'t say Armenians, \\nthey said, \"of them.\" She says, \"No, no, no, none!\" Then she ran downstairs to\\nour place, and says, \"Emma, Emma, you have to leave!\" I say, \"They\\'ve killed\\nShagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won\\'t be living for me without \\nShagen. Let them kill us, too!\" She insists, saying, \"Emma, get out of here, \\ngo to Khalida\\'s, and give me the key. When they come I\\'ll say that it\\'s my \\ndaughter\\'s apartment, that they\\'re off visiting someone.\" I gave her the key \\nand went to the neighbor\\'s, but I couldn\\'t endure it. I say, \"Igor, you stay \\nhere, I\\'m going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa\\'s . . . Papa\\'s there.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and \\nValery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in \\nthe courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they\\'re shouting, howling, \\nand I didn\\'t think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived\\nin the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw\\nan Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, \"Madar, \\nUncle Shagen\\'s gone, let\\'s go see, maybe he\\'s dead in the garage or near the \\ngarage, let\\'s at least bring the corpse into the house. \"He shouts, \"Aunt \\nEmma, where do you think you\\'re going?! Go back into the house, I\\'ll look for \\nhim.\" I say, \"Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar, \\nI\\'m coming too.\" Well he wouldn\\'t let me go all the same, he says, \"You stay \\nhere with us, I\\'m go look.\" He went and looked, and came back and said, \"Aunt \\nEmma, there\\'s no one there, the garage is closed. \"Madar went off again and \\nthen returned and said, \"Aunt Emma, they\\'re already killed Alik, and Valery\\'s \\nthere . . . wheezing.\"\\n\\nMadar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, \"Don\\'t go near him, \\nor we\\'ll put you next to him.\" He got scared--he\\'s young--and came back and \\nsaid, \"I\\'m going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take \\nAlik, maybe he\\'ll live . . . \" They grew up together in our courtyard, they \\nknew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but\\nnot a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and \\ncalled, and called, and called--nothing.\\n\\nI went upstairs to the neighbor\\'s. Igor says, \"Two police cars drove up over \\nthere, their headlights are on, but they\\'re not touching them, they are still \\nlying where they were, they\\'re still lying there . . . \"We watched out the\\nwindow until four o\\'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn\\'t\\ntake my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six\\no\\'clock in the morning I got up and said, \"Igor, you stay here at home, don\\'t\\ngo out, don\\'t go anywhere, I\\'m going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or\\nalive . . . let me go . . . I\\'ve got the keys from work.\"\\n\\nAt six o\\'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another \\ndoctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, \"Doctor, is \\nShagen there?\" He says, \"What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!\" I \\nwanted to go in, but he wouldn\\'t let me. There were only four people in there,\\nthey said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn\\'t let me in. They\\nsaid, \"Shagen\\'s not here, he\\'s alive somewhere, he\\'ll come back.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s already seven o\\'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck\\nwith three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with\\nthem. I say, \"Sara Baji [\"Sister\" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they\\'ve\\nprobably brought Shagen.\" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back\\nand says, \"No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it\\'s a younger person.\" Now Shagen \\njust happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they \\nsaid it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, \"Doctor, they\\'ve \\nbrought Shagen in dead.\" He says, \"Why are you carrying on like that, dead, \\ndead . . . he\\'s alive.\" But then he went all the same, and when he came back \\nthe look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They\\nknew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, \"Doctor, \\nis it Shagen?\" He says, \"No, Emma, it\\'s not he, it\\'s somebody else entirely.\" \\nI say, \"Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I\\'ll find out all the same anyway, \\nif not today, then tomorrow.\" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the\\noffice. He says, \"Emma, go, go calm down a little.\" Another one of our \\ncolleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous \\ncondition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn\\'t Shagen. A few minutes \\nlater another colleague comes in and says, \"Oh, poor Emma!\" When she said it \\nlike that there was no hope left.\\n\\n   That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured \\npeople.\\n\\nAt night someone took me home. I said, \"Igor, Papa\\'s been killed.\"\\n\\nOn the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital: \\nI had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is \\nsurrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. \"Hey, citizen, where \\nare you going?\" I say, \"I work here,\" and from inside someone shouts, \"Yes, \\nyes, that\\'s our cook, let her in.\" I went right to the head doctor\\'s office\\nand there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to\\nwork with us at the hospital. He says, \"Emma, Shagen\\'s been taken to Baku.\\nIn the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku.\" I\\nsay, \"Doctor, how will I bury him?\" He says, \"We\\'re taking care of all that,\\ndon\\'t you worry, we\\'ll do everything, we\\'ll tell you about it. Where did you\\nspend the night?\" I say, \"I was at home.\" He says, \"What do you mean you\\nwere at home?! You were at home alone?\" I say, \"No, Igor was there too.\" He\\nsays, \"You can\\'t stay home, we\\'re getting an ambulance right now, wait just\\none second, the head doctor is coming, we\\'re arranging an ambulance right\\nnow, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here\\nlike a patient, and you\\'ll stay here and we\\'ll se~ later what to do next ...\"\\nHis last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor\\'s name is Izyat Jamalogli\\nSadukhov.\\n\\nThe \"ambulance\" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a \\npatient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the \\nhospital until the 4th.\\n\\nSome police car came and they said, \"Emma, let\\'s go.\" And the women, our \\ncolleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, \"Where are \\nyou taking her?\" I say, \"They\\'re going to kill me, too . . . \" And the\\ninvestigator says, \"Why are you saying that, we\\'re going to make a positive\\nidentification.\" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I\\nstill can\\'t remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, \"Let\\'s \\ngo, we need to be certain, maybe it\\'s not Shagen.\" And when I saw the caskets,\\nlying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, \"I can\\'t look, no.\"\\nThe investigator says, \"Are there any identifying marks?\" I say, \"Let me see\\nthe clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I\\'ll recognize them.\" He says, \\n\"Isn\\'t they\\'re anything on his body?\" I say he has seven gold teeth and his \\nfinger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had\\nbeen injured at work . . .\\n\\nThey brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they \\nbrought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, \"Oh, \\nthey burned him!\" I shouted, I don\\'t know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat \\ndown, I don\\'t remember. And that investigator says, \"Well fine, fine, since \\nwe\\'ve identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since\\nhe has seven gold teeth . . . \"\\n\\nOn the 4th they told me: \"Emma, it\\'s time to bury Shagen now.\" I cried, \"How, \\nhow can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he\\'s sick? I should inform \\nhis relatives, he has three sisters, I can\\'t do it by myself.\" They say, \"OK, \\nyou know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they \\nget here from Yerevan? There\\'s no transportation, it s impossible.\"\\n\\nHe was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in \\nSumgait. They asked me, \"Where do you want to bury him?\" I said, \"I want to \\nbury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,\" I\\'m \\nshouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, \"Do you know what \\nit means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!\" I say, \"What do you mean, \\narson? Don\\'t they know what\\'s going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that\\nthey killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don\\'t have anyone \\nanymore.\" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He\\nsays, \"Let\\'s bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year, \\nif it calms down, I\\'ll help you move him to Karabagh . . . \"\\n\\nOur trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the\\ninvestigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then\\nat the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime. \\nThen they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said, \\n\"Ismailov, look, is that you?\" He says, \"Yes.\" \"Well look, here you\\'re \\ndescribing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?\" He says, \\n\"Yes.\" \"And now you\\'re telling it differently?\" He says, \"Well maybe I \\nforgot!\" Like that.\\n\\nThe witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going\\nalong Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a \\nVolga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were \\ninvolved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it\\'s unclear\\nwho--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side\\nof the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports \\njacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, \"What\\'s your nationality?\" He \\nsays, \"Armenian.\" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, \"If he\\'s an\\nArmenian, kill him, kill him!\" They started beating him, they broke seven of\\nhis ribs, and his heart . . . I don\\'t know, they did something there, too \\n. . . it\\'s too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he \\nhad an armature shaft. He says, \"I picked it up, it was lying near a bush, \\nthat\\'s where I got it.\" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he\\nhad already had it. He said, \"I hit him twice,\" he said, \" . . . once or twice\\non the head with that rod.\" And he said that when he started to beat him \\nShagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said, \\n\"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment,\\nkilling someone,\" he says, \"and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or\\nnot?\" I said, \"You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you\\ncame back to hit him again?\" He went back and looked and he was already dead.\\n\"After that,\" that bastard Tale said, \"after that I went home.\"\\n\\nI said, \"You . . . you . . . little snake,\" I said, \"Are you a thief and a \\nmurderer?\" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They\\nwere taken. He says he didn\\'t take them\\n\\nWhen they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was\\nother people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned\\nit, that hasn\\'t been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, \"How can you \\nhave the trial when you don\\'t know who burned the car?\" He said something, but\\nI didn\\'t get what he was saying. But I said, \"You still haven\\'t straightened \\neverything out, I think that\\'s unjust.\"\\n\\nWhen they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him. \\nIn the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80\\npercent of his body . . .\\n\\nAnd I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good \\ncraftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his \\nown hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the \\ntime. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the \\nArmy. And now they\\'re fatherless...\\n\\nI couldn\\'t sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15\\nyears\\' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn\\'t\\nknow what to do with myself, I said, \"How can that be? You,\" I said, \"you are \\nsaying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years\\' \\ndeprivation of freedom?\" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, \"Let me at that\\ncreep, with my bare hands I\\'ll . . . \" A relative restrained me, and there\\nwere all those military people there . . . I lest. I said,\" This isn\\'t a \\nSoviet trial, this is unjust!\" That\\'s what I shouted, l said it and left . . .\\n\\nI said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street, \\nthey were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" and \"Glory to Turkey!\" And during the \\ntrial I said to that Ismailov, \"What does that mean, \\'Glory to Turkey\\'?\" I \\nstill don\\'t understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet \\nUnion. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I still\\ndon\\'t understand why \"Glory to Turkey!\" I asked that question twice and got no\\nanswer . . .

I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information\\nwe are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the \\npeople in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily\\nbusiness, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are\\nolder men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to\\nimagine ????  It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \\nto view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\\nin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\\nSOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\\nthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \\nknow who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\\nsuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\\nsupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\\nammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\nfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\\nby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\nof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\\nare back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\\nan 8 year old girl just happened to be.\\nWe are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is \\nthe Israeli way of telling us that \"if you\\'re gonna hurt our soldiers\\nyou\\'re gonna pay the price\".  We accept this as a price we have to pay\\nto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting\\nthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather\\njust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young \\nmen to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are\\ntaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.\\nIsrael\\'s retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\\nwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\\non the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \\nISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \\nleverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\\nThe people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a \\nregular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that\\nthe so called \"Security Zone\" is necessary for the protection of \\nNorthern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation\\nwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,\\nthan it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the \\nestablishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect\\nour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the\\nbest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the\\nestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.\\n\\nI have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only\\nreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace\\nsettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and\\npeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure\\nno one on either side of the border is shelled.\\nThis is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\\nrealize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\\nits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\\nIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\\nwould have resulted in.  \\nIf Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw \\nunilaterally from the so-called \"Security Zone\" before the conclusion\\nof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,\\nadvance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel\\'s \\npublic image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations \\nsince Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in \\npeace and has already offered some important concessions.\\nAlong with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah\\nbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not \\naccept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a\\nshelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone\\nand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.\\nThere seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\\ngoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \\ncircumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\\ncapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\\nin all other parts of Lebanon.\\n  \\n|> If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a \\n|> question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing\\n|> justifies murder.\\n\\nI agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\\nCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\\n\\n I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make\\n|> similar statements, maybe after eliminating all Israelis, jews, ?

Currently I have  \\n8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.  \\nboth banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking  \\nof running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know  \\nthat more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I  \\ncan see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about  \\n$400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,  \\nthe entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that  \\nthe machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather  \\navoid...\\n\\nSo my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work  \\nwell with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about  \\n$90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how  \\ndo they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the  \\nextra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the  \\nISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so  \\nprobably all of this is just wishful thinking...

Sophisticated\\nencryption can have this effect in the United States.  When\\nexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence\\nactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has\\nbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conduct\\nelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law\\nenforcement and national security interests, while at the same time\\nprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As\\nencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,\\ninnovative approaches.\\n\\nIn the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has\\ndeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through\\nencryption that is substantially more robust than the current\\ngovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed\\nto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys\\nwill allow the government to gain access to encrypted information\\nonly with appropriate legal authorization.\\n\\nTo assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect\\nand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted\\ninformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:\\n\\nINSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS\\n\\nThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,\\nshall request manufacturers of communications hardware which\\nincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed\\nkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law\\nenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from\\nthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to\\nensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow\\nmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications\\nhardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the\\nsecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do\\nnot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the\\ngovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that\\nare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-\\nescrow system.\\n\\nKEY-ESCROW\\n\\nThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate\\nentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits\\ninstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the key\\nholder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent\\nunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only\\nto government agencies that have established their authority to\\nacquire the content of those communications that have been\\nencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney\\nGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which\\nan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such\\ncommunications.\\n\\nPROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES\\n\\nThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate\\nU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to\\nfacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted\\nwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems\\nthat process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this\\nprocess to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of\\na final standard within six months of this directive. \\n\\nThe Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to\\nthe extent needed to preserve the government\\'s ability to conduct\\nlawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure\\nlaw enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General\\nshall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture\\nSuper Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.\\n',\n",

Malpractice insurance and awards account for less than 1% of\\ntotal health care costs in the US.  In 1991, according to a survey of \\nphysicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averaged\\npaying 3.7% of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance.  \\nMalpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 1985;\\nthey\\'ve declined significantly since then.  At the same time, health\\ncare costs have increased more than any period in history.\\n\\nAs far as \"defensive medicine\" is concerned, the AMA estimates that its\\ntotal impact is about $7 billion per year.  That\\'s about 8% of the total\\ncurrent INCREASE in health care costs -- and the estimate is from a group\\nthat could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicine\\non health care.\\n\\nAs small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things, however,\\nClinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnification\\nof MD\\'s against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by their\\nspecialties.

The\\n> telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two\\n> values:\\n\\n>    E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and\\n>    E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,\\n\\n> which are transmitted over the telephone line.

The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after\\n> an authorized wiretap has been installed.\\n\\nFirst question: When will the LawEnforcmentField be transmitted, and how\\ndoes the remote Clipper Chip handle it? Is it transmitted periodically\\nin the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? Does the\\nphone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever,\\nor tries it to turn them into voice-output ? (Which would not be disturbing)\\n\\n\\n> At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key\\n> escrow agencies enters the vault.

These random values serve as seeds to generate unit\\n> keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a\\n> function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.\\n\\nSecond question: Why!?!? Why is such a strange procedure used, and not\\na real RNG ? This turns those S1,S2 in a kind of bottleneck for system-\\nsecurity.\\n\\n\\n> When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they\\n> will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get\\n> access to the communications line.

I would rather have the untried\\nrookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven\\nhimself to be average at best. I don\\'t care if he is 15; if he plays\\nbetter than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent\\nminor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las\\nVegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major\\nleague hitter (which is good for a catcher, I\\'ll admit). Santiago\\'s\\nnumbers would probably come out the same as Sandy\\'s, but I don\\'t have\\nthe league data from the mid-80s to check it out.\\n\\nThat being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to\\nstart the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league\\nseason in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very\\npoorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill\\nare not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers,\\nthey are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around\\n.220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on\\nthe Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was\\njust as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87.

We can get back to the \\nquestion of which law should be used in the territories later. Also, you have \\nnot adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights.\\n\\n   What do you expect me to tell you, Master of Wisdom, when I did explain my\\n   point in the post, that you \"responded to\". The point is that since Israel \\n   is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights \\n   to the Occupied Palestineans, which is exactly similar the automatic \\n   deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society.\\n\\nIf a state can deprive all it\\'s citizens of human rights by its actions, then \\ntell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?\\n\\n   |> |> In conjugtion with the above, when a group of people occupies others \\n   |> |> territories and rule them by force, then this group would be -willingly or \\n   |> |> unwillingly- deprived from some of its rights. \\n\\n   |> Such as the right to live?

Why ? because\\n   any system can solve it. \\n   The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here (all palestine). \\n\\nI asked for which system should be used, that will preserve human rights for \\nall people involved. I assumed that was obvious, but I won\\'t repeat that \\nmistake. Now that I have straightened that out, I\\'m eagerly awaiting your \\nreply.\\n\\n   Joseph Weitz (administrator responsible for Jewish colonization) \\n   said it best when writing in his diary in 1940:\\n\\t   \"Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both\\n\\t   peoples together in this country....

And there is no other way than\\n\\t   to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries, to\\n\\t   transfer all of them; not one village, not one tribe, should be \\n\\t   left....

There is no other way out.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   DAVAR, 29 September, 1967\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   (\"Courtesy\" of Marc Afifi)\\n\\nJust a question: If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to \\ngetting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAS\\ncharter (that\\'s the english translations, if you have other information I\\'d\\nbe interested to have you translate it) why should we give any credence to \\na _private_ paper even older? I\\'m not going to get into the question if he\\nwrote the above, but it\\'s fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have\\ntheir share of fanatics. Guess what..? Those are not the people that will\\nmake any lasting peace in the region. Ever. It\\'s those who are willing to \\nmake a tabula rasa and start over, and willing to give in order to get \\nsomething back.\\n\\n\\n   \"We\" and \"our\" either refers to Zionists or Jews (i donot know which). \\n\\n   Well, i can give you an answer, you Master of Wisdom, I will NOT suggest the \\n   imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem !\\n\\n   I think that is fair enough .\\n\\nNo, that is _not_ an answer, since I asked for a system that could solve \\nthe problem. You said any could be used, then you provided a contradiction.\\nGuess where that takes your logic?

Even if we assume that these \"trusted agents\" are really entering\\n\\ta wide range of S1 and S2 seeds (rather than using the same one all the\\n\\ttime to reduce the key search space to 30 bits), I assume they are not\\n\\tdoing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry\\n\\tat carefully selected points to encode data.  They would presumably be\\n\\tpunching numbers into a computer, which for all they know could program\\n\\tthe chips in a manner completely independent of the S1 and S2 values they\\n\\tare feeding into the system.\\n\\nS1 and S2 are clearly the backdoor - we should assume they are all\\ncompromised.  If they\\'re not compromisable, why the hell not use a\\nhardware true random number source.  There isn\\'t a random number\\nsource *anywhere* in this proposal.  The whole thing is deterministic\\nfrom the day the serial number is stamped on the chip.\\n\\nNope, it can\\'t be trusted.  This is all about two levels of access -\\nthe (possibly honest) key escrow that police forces have to use, and\\nostensibly the FBI; and the back door that lets the NSA decode *everything*\\non the fly - and maybe some back-handers to the FBI when they want a\\nwarrantless tab in exchange for favours.\\n\\nG\\n',\n",

It was also from Cal.     What I did was go to the local junkyard and pick up a diaphragm from a '68      Lesabre with the same heater set up.  It worked for me, but a little bit slow   to change from vents to defogger.  Better than nothing!\\n\",\n",

This is a second RFD, replacing\\nthe one originally posted in January \\'93 (and never taken to a vote).  The\\nproposed groups are described below:\\n\\nNAME: \\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup\\nSTATUS:  Unmoderated.\\nPURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about\\n\\t system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.\\n\\nNAME:\\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc\\nSTATUS:\\t Unmoderated.\\nPURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,\\n\\t including issues such as security, networking features, console\\n\\t mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.\\n\\nRATIONALE:\\n\\tMicrosoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family\\n\\tof operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish\\n\\tto argue about the meaning of an \"OS\").  The family ranges from\\n\\tModular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to\\n\\tWindows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over\\n\\t50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the\\n\\tactual release is slated for May/June \\'93.\\n\\n\\tWhile Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares\\n\\tan application programming interface with the other members of the\\n\\tWindows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-\\n\\tdows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking\\n\\tand security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for\\n\\tWindows 3.1.\\n\\n\\tThe user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows\\n\\t3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses\\n\\tProgram Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-\\n\\tsents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced\\n\\tWindows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and\\n\\tNT also runs existing 3.1 applications.\\n\\n\\tThus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following\\n\\tgroups with the other members of the Windows family:\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.apps\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32\\n\\t\\n\\tThe following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as\\n\\twell as Windows 3.1:\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.announce\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.advocacy\\n\\t\\n\\tIn conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the\\n\\tWindows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal\\n\\tstructures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating\\n\\tsystems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have\\n\\tundergone major rewrites without having been split into separate\\n\\tnewsgroup hierarchies.\\n\\n\\tFurther, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --\\n\\twhen the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-\\n\\tgeneration Windows, \"Chicago\", debuts next year, surely it should\\n\\tremain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-\\n\\ttification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?\\n\\n\\nDISCUSSION PERIOD:\\n\\tThe discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  \\n\\nVOTING:\\n\\tThe CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on\\n\\tthe feedback received during the discussion period.

Features\\n===========\\n\\nDMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:\\n\\n\\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\\n\\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\\n\\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\\n\\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\\n\\n - color-space selection\\n\\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\\n\\n - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\\n\\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\\n\\n...\\n\\n4. Technical information\\n========================\\n\\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\\n(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\\n\\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\\n+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\\n\\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\\non NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish\\nareas.\\n\\n...\\n\\n--\\nStefan Eckart, stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de\\n\",\n",

I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd\\ntake Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1\\nnetminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than\\nthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records\\nare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as\\nthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.\\n\\nYou say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well\\nbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in\\nthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,\\nthe defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.\\n\\n> The same\\n> for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\\n> great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\\n> you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\\n\\nBut I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play\\nfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just\\nmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that\\nabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm\\nbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.\\n\\nAs for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the\\noffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the\\nsave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't\\nget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's\\nwhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the\\nshooter to beat him.\\n\\n> But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\\n> stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\\n> doesn't have a game like that in him.\\n\\nI seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on\\nopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending\\nchamps.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was\\nsenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a\\nMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game\\nand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are\\npart of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and\\nI'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current\\n7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I\\ndon't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any\\ntickets next season:-).\\n\\n                                         \\\\ \\\\\\nJoe Dakes                                 \\\\/\\\\\\nAT&T Microelectronics                      \\\\/\\\\\\n555 Union Boulevard                         \\\\ \\\\\\nAllentown, PA  18103                     LET'S GO FLYERS! \\nalux1!jmd                                     \\\\ \\\\\\njmd@aluxpo.att.com                             \\\\ \\\\__________\\n                                                \\\\____/_//__/\\n\\n\",\n",

    "\n",
    "A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. By contrast, if most of the elements are nonzero, then the matrix is considered dense. When storing and manipulating sparse matrices on a computer, it is beneficial and often necessary to use specialized algorithms and data structures that take advantage of the sparse structure of the matrix.<br /><br />\n",

    "This is interpretation of RP:<br />\n",
    "[0, 2, 3, 5] --> the last number is the number of NZV (so it is 5)<br />\n",

You use n-grams in a probabillistic manner to perform tasks such as predicting the next sequence in a series, which wouldnt seem very useful until you start thinking about applications such as search engines that try to predict the word you want to type based on previous letters you have supplied. However, the technique has all sorts of applications, such as in DNA sequencing and data compression. The following example shows how to create n-grams from the 20 Newsgroups dataset."
