    "In previous lab, we explored how to make predictions (with uncertainties) about upcoming elections based on the Real Clear Politics poll. This assignment also focuses on election prediction, but we are going to implement and evaluate a number of more sophisticated forecasting techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to focus on the 2012 Presidential election. Analysts like Nate Silver, Drew Linzer, and Sam Wang developed highly accurate models that correctly forecasted most or all of the election outcomes in each of the 50 states. We will explore how hard it is to recreate similarly successful models. The goals of this assignment are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To practice data manipulation with Pandas\n",
    "1. To develop intuition about the interplay of **precision**, **accuracy**, and **bias** when making predictions\n",
    "1. To better understand how election forecasts are constructed\n",

    "The data for our analysis will come from demographic and polling data. We will simulate building our model on October 2, 2012 -- approximately one month before the election. \n",

(The calculation of the sampling error itself is an exercise in statistics. Its fun to think of how you could arrive at the sampling error if it was not given to you. One way to do it would be to assume this was a two-choice situation and use binomial sampling error for the non-unknown answers, and further model the error for those who answered 'Unknown'.)\n",

There are several reasons this might happen:\n",

    "Suppose that we have a set of binary (that is, taking the values 0 or 1) observations $Y_1,\\cdots,Y_n$, and for each observation $Y_i$ we have a vector of features $X_i$. The logistic regression model assumes that there is some set of **weights**, **coefficients**, or **parameters** $\\beta$, one for each feature, so that the data were generated by flipping a weighted coin whose probability of giving a 1 is given by the following equation:\n",

Once we do this, we can use these coefficients to make predictions about data we have not yet observed (the 2012 election).\n",

    "Sometimes this estimation procedure will overfit the training data yielding predictions that are difficult to generalize to unobserved data. Usually, this occurs when the magnitudes of the components of $\\beta$ become too large. To prevent this, we can use a technique called *regularization* to make the procedure prefer parameter vectors that have smaller magnitude. We can adjust the strength of this regularization to reduce the error in our predictions.\n",

By the time you start doing this homework, you will have learnt the basics of logistic regression, but not all the mechanisms of cross-validation of data sets.

The pros pretty much start from poll-averaging, adding in demographics and economic information, and moving onto trend-estimation as the election gets closer. They also employ models of likely voters vs registered voters, and how independents might break.
