    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Rotten Tomatoes gathers movie reviews from critics. An [entry on the website](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/primer/reviews/?type=top_critics) typically consists of a short quote, a link to the full review, and a Fresh/Rotten classification which summarizes whether the critic liked/disliked the movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When critics give quantitative ratings (say 3/4 stars, Thumbs up, etc.), determining the Fresh/Rotten classification is easy. However, publications like the New York Times don't assign numerical ratings to movies, and thus the Fresh/Rotten classification must be inferred from the text of the review itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This basic task of categorizing text has many applications. All of the following questions boil down to text classification:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Is a movie review positive or negative?\n",
    " * Is an email spam, or not?\n",
    " * Is a comment on a blog discussion board appropriate, or not?\n",
    " * Is a tweet about your company positive, or not?\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Language is incredibly nuanced, and there is an entire field of computer science dedicated to the topic (Natural Language Processing). Nevertheless, we can construct basic language models using fairly straightforward techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be starting with a database of Movies, derived from the MovieLens dataset. This dataset includes information for about 10,000 movies, including the IMDB id for each movie. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task is to download Rotten Tomatoes reviews from 3000 of these movies, using the Rotten Tomatoes API (Application Programming Interface)."

    "### Working with Web APIs\n",
    "Web APIs are a more convenient way for programs to interact with websites. Rotten Tomatoes has a nice API that gives access to its data in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this, you will first need to [register for an API key](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/member/register). For \"application URL\", you can use anything -- it doesn't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have a key, the [documentation page](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/iodocs) shows the various data you can fetch from Rotten Tomatoes -- each type of data lives at a different web address. The basic pattern for fetching this data with Python is as follows (compare this to the `Movie Reviews` tab on the documentation page):"
